## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

**Why are types important?**

- Types define the meaning and usage of data in our programs.
- They tell the compiler what kind of data you're working with (numbers, characters, etc.)
- Knowing the type allows the compiler to perform the correct operations and avoid errors.

**C++ and Data Types:**

- C++ offers various built-in types like integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.
- Additionally, it provides mechanisms to create custom types (more on this later).
- The C++ library uses these mechanisms to define complex types like strings and vectors.

**Types and Operations:**

- The type of a variable determines the meaning of operations performed on it.
- For example:
    - `i = i + j;` has a different meaning when `i` and `j` are integers (arithmetic addition)
    - compared to when they are `Sales_item` objects (adding object components).

**Summary:**

Understanding data types is essential for writing effective and error-free C++ programs. This chapter focuses on built-in types and lays the groundwork for creating more complex user-defined types later.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Primitive Built-in Types, what are they?</u></f>
 
C++ provides a set of fundamental data types called #primitive built-in types. These types represent basic building blocks for storing data in your programs.

**Types included:**

- **Arithmetic types:** Represent numeric values used for calculations.
    - `int`: Stores integers (whole numbers).
    - `float` and `double`: Represent single-precision and double-precision floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points).
    - `char`: Stores a single character.
- **Boolean type:**
    - `bool`: Represents logical values, `true` or `false`.

**Special type:**

- **void:** Represents the absence of a value. Used in functions that don't return anything.

**Key points to remember:**

- Each type has a specific size and range of values it can store.
- Primitive types are fundamental building blocks for more complex data structures.

**Example:**

```cpp
int age = 25; // Stores an integer value (age)
float pi = 3.14159; // Stores a floating-point value (pi)
char initial = 'A'; // Stores a single character (initial)
bool isStudent = true; // Stores a boolean value (isStudent)
```

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>Arithmetic Types:</u></f>

**Key Concepts:**

- **Integral Types:** Represent integer values (whole numbers).

    - `bool`: Stores logical values (`true` or `false`). Size not guaranteed (typically 1 byte).
    - `char`: Represents a single character. Minimum size: 8 bits.
    - `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`: Extended character sets for Unicode support (16 or 32 bits).
    - `short`, `int`, `long`, `long long`: Integers of varying sizes (minimum sizes specified).
    
- **Floating-Point Types:** Represent numbers with decimal points.

    - `float`: Single-precision (minimum 6 significant digits). Typically 32 bits.
    - `double`: Double-precision (minimum 10 significant digits). Typically 64 bits.
    - `long double`: Extended-precision (minimum 10 significant digits). Varies (often 96 or 128 bits).

**Size Considerations:**

- The exact size of each type can vary depending on the compiler and target architecture.
- The C++ standard guarantees minimum sizes, but compilers can use larger sizes.
- Larger types can typically hold a wider range of values.

**Machine-Level Representation:**

- Computers store data in bits (0 or 1).
- Memory is organized in bytes (usually 8 bits).
- Words (groups of bytes) The basic unit of storage, usually a small number of bytes.
- The type of data stored determines how the bits are interpreted (e.g., integer vs. character).

**Important Points:**

- Character types provide basic character storage (`char`) and support for extended character sets (`wchar_t`, etc.).
- Integral types guarantee a hierarchy of sizes (`int` at least as large as `short`).
- Floating-point types offer different levels of precision (`float`, `double`, `long double`).
- Understanding machine-level representation helps connect data types to their underlying storage.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Type Conversions:</u></f>

**Understanding types and conversions is crucial for writing predictable C++ code.** This summary highlights key points about type conversions:

- **Type Conversions:** When using an object of one type where another type is expected, an automatic conversion happens.
- **Arithmetic Types:** Conversions occur between different arithmetic types (int, float, double, etc.).
- **bool Conversions:**
    - Assigning an arithmetic type to bool: 0 becomes false, any non-zero value becomes true.
    - Assigning bool to arithmetic type: true becomes 1, false becomes 0.
- **Floating-Point to Integral:** Assigning a floating-point value to an integral type truncates (removes) the decimal part.
- **Integral to Floating-Point:** Assigning an integral value to a floating-point type results in a value with a zero fractional part. Precision loss might occur if the integer has more bits than the floating-point object can hold.
- **Unsigned Out-of-Range Values:** Assigning an out-of-range value to an unsigned type results in the ***remainder after modulo by the number of values it can hold*** (e.g., -1 to an 8-bit unsigned char becomes 255).
- **Signed Out-of-Range Values:** Assigning an out-of-range value to a signed type leads to **undefined behavior**. The program might crash, produce unexpected results, or appear to work fine (but can be unreliable).

**Examples:**

- bool b = 42; // b is true
- int i = b; // i has value 1
- i = 3.14; // i has value 3
- double pi = i; // pi has value 3.0
- unsigned char c = -1; // assuming 8-bit chars, c has value 255
- signed char c2 = 256; // assuming 8-bit chars, the value of c2 is ***undefined***

**Important Advice:**

- **Avoid Undefined Behavior:** Undefined behavior is difficult to detect and can lead to unpredictable program behavior across different compilers or situations. Strive to write code that avoids it.
- **Minimize Implementation-Defined Behavior:** Implementation-defined behavior relies on compiler-specific details. This can make code non-portable and lead to issues when running it on different systems.

**Additional Notes:**

- The compiler applies these conversions when using values in expressions.
- Non-zero values used as conditions evaluate to true, while 0 evaluates to false.
- Using bool values directly in arithmetic expressions is generally not recommended. They are implicitly converted to 0 or 1, which might not be the intended behavior.

## <font color="green0">Expressions involving Unsigned Types</f>

**Beware the Implicit Conversion:**

While we wouldn't intentionally assign negative values to unsigned variables, it can happen indirectly. When mixing `int` (signed) and `unsigned` values in expressions, the `int` is typically converted to `unsigned`.

**Example:**

```cpp
unsigned u = 10;
int i = -42;

// -42 (int) converted to unsigned before addition
std::cout << u + i << std::endl;  // Prints unexpected value (often 4294967295 on 32-bit systems)
```

This conversion behaves like assigning a negative value to an unsigned type. The negative value "wraps around" to the positive end of the unsigned range.

**Remember Unsigned Can't Be Negative:**

Subtracting from an unsigned value requires ensuring the result isn't negative. An unsigned value can never be less than zero.

**Example:**

```cpp
unsigned u1 = 42, u2 = 10;
std::cout << u1 - u2 << std::endl;  // OK (result is positive: 32)
std::cout << u2 - u1 << std::endl;  // Unexpected result (wraps around)
```

**Unsigned Loops Need Special Care:**

We can't directly use `unsigned` for loops that decrement to zero. Unsigned variables can't be less than zero, so the loop condition will never be false.

**Example (Incorrect):**

```cpp
// This loop NEVER terminates!
for (unsigned u = 10; u >= 0; --u) {
  // ...
}
```

**Solution:**

Use a `while` loop and decrement before the comparison:

```cpp
unsigned u = 11;  // Start one past the first desired value
while (u > 0) {
  --u;
  // ... (now u will be 0 on the last iteration)
}
```

**Key Takeaway:**

Mixing signed and unsigned types can lead to surprising results. Be mindful of implicit conversions and the limitations of unsigned types to avoid unexpected behavior in your C++ code.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Literals:</u></f>

**Literals: The Building Blocks of Values**

- Literals are fixed values directly written in code, representing self-evident data.
- Every literal has a specific type determined by its form and value.

**Integer and Floating-Point Literals: Your Number Options**

- Integers can be written in decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), or hexadecimal (base 16).
    - Examples:
        - Decimal: 20
        - Octal (starts with 0): 024
        - Hexadecimal (starts with 0x or 0X): 0x14
- Integer literal type depends on its value and notation:
    - Decimal: Defaults to the smallest signed type (int, long, long long) that can hold it.
    - Octal and Hexadecimal: Defaults to the smallest signed or unsigned type (int, unsigned int, long, etc.) that can hold it.
- Special note: There are no short integer literals.
- Suffixes (covered later in your book) can be used to override default types.
- Though stored in signed types, decimal literals themselves cannot be negative. The minus sign (-) negates the value after the literal.

**Floating-Point Literals: Numbers with Decimals or Exponents**

- Represented with a decimal point or exponent (scientific notation using E or e).
    - Examples:
        - 3.14159
        - 3.14159E0 (exponent of 0)
        
        - 0e0 (zero with exponent of 0)
        - .001
- Default type is double. Suffixes (covered later) can be used for type control.

**Character and String Literals: Representing Text**

- A single character in single quotes is a character literal (type char).
    - Example: 'a'
- Zero or more characters in double quotes are a string literal (array of constant chars).
    - Example: "Hello World!"
- String literals are actually arrays with a null character ('\0') appended by the compiler. This means a string literal's size is one more than it appears.
    - Example: 'A' (single character) vs. "A" (array of 'A' and '\0')
- Adjacent string literals separated by spaces/tabs/newlines are concatenated (joined) into a single literal.
    - Example (multiline string):
        
        ```cpp
        std::cout << "a really, really long string literal "
                  "that spans two lines" << std::endl;
        ```

## <font color="yellow"><u>Escape Sequences:</u></f>

**Escape sequences** are a way to represent special characters or characters that have a reserved meaning in C++. These characters cannot be directly typed in the code.

**Why use escape sequences?**

- Certain characters, like backspace or tab, don't have a visual representation when printed.
- Some characters, like quotes or backslash, have special meaning in C++ and can't be used literally.

**How do they work?**

Escape sequences start with a backslash (). Here are some common escape sequences:

|Escape Sequence|Meaning|Example (prints)|
|---|---|---|
|`\n`|Newline|Starts a new line|
|`\t`|Horizontal tab|Moves the cursor a few spaces to the right|
|`\a`|Alert (bell)|Produces a beep sound (if supported by the terminal)|
|`\v`|Vertical tab|Moves the cursor down a few lines (less common)|
|`\b`|Backspace|Deletes the character before the cursor|
|`\"`|Double quote|Prints a double quote character|
|`\\`|Backslash|Prints a backslash character|
|`\?`|Question mark|Prints a question mark character|
|`\'`|Single quote|Prints a single quote character (use with caution)|
|`\r`|Carriage return|Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line (less common)|
|`\f`|Formfeed|Moves the printer to the next page (less common)|

**Using escape sequences:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello!\n";  // Prints "Hello!" followed by a newline
  std::cout << "\tGoodbye.\n";  // Prints a tab, then "Goodbye." followed by a newline
  return 0;
}
```

**Generalized escape sequences:**

You can also define escape sequences using hexadecimal or octal digits:

- `\xHH...HH` - Hexadecimal code for the character (HH represents hexadecimal digits)
- `\ddd` - Octal code for the character (ddd represents octal digits)

**Example:**

```cpp
std::cout << "Hi \x4dOM\115!\n";  // Prints "Hi MOM!" followed by a newline
```

**Things to note:**

- In octal escape sequences, only the first three digits are considered.
- Hexadecimal escape sequences can represent characters outside the standard 8-bit character set, but these might not work on all systems.

By understanding escape sequences, you can effectively control how your C++ program displays text and interacts with the user.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Specifying Literal Types:</u></f>

This note outlines how to control the type of literals (fixed values) in your C++ code.

**Table Summary (Key Points):**

![image](https://github.com/Ali-Elbana/Modern-Cpp-Notes/assets/97269796/1579eeec-2ae4-416e-b3a2-e8acd169f2be)

**Key Points:**

- Use uppercase L for long literals (lowercase l can be confused with 1).
- Suffixes control signedness (u/U for unsigned) and size (l/L/LL for long, long long).
- Combine suffixes (e.g., UL for unsigned long/long long).
- Suffix determines the smallest type that can hold the literal's value.

**Example:**

```cpp
// Unsigned long if the value fits, otherwise unsigned long long
unsigned long long big_value = 42ULL;
```

**Remember:** Specifying the type explicitly can improve code readability and avoid potential type conversion issues.

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>Boolean and Pointer Literals:</u></f>

**Booleans:**

- `true` and `false` are literals used to represent boolean values.
- They directly assign the corresponding boolean value (`true` or `false`) to a variable.

**Example:**

```cpp
bool test = false;  // Assigns the value 'false' to the 'test' variable
```

**Pointer Literals:**

- `nullptr` is a special literal used to represent a null pointer.
- It indicates the absence of a valid memory address.
- We'll explore pointers and `nullptr` in more detail later.

**Note:**

This summary provides a basic introduction to boolean and pointer literals.
