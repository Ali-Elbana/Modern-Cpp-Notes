Types are fundamental to all programming in C++.

- **Core Concepts:**
     
	- **Types are fundamental:** Define storage requirements and operations for objects.
	- **Built-in types:** int, char, etc., closely tied to hardware.
	- **const:** Objects cannot be changed after initialization.
	- **Compound types:** Pointers, references, defined in terms of other types.
	- **Classes:** Define custom types with data and operations.
	
- **Defined Terms:**
     
	- **address:** Memory location identifier.
	- **alias declaration:** Creates a synonym for a type (using name = type).
	- **arithmetic types:** Boolean, character, integer, floating-point.
	- **array:** Collection of unnamed objects accessed by index (covered later).
	- **auto:** Type specifier automatically deduced from initializer.
	- **base type:** Type specifier preceding declarators in a declaration.
	- **bind:** Associates a name with an entity (e.g., reference to object).
	- **byte:** Smallest addressable memory unit (usually 8 bits).
	- **class member:** Part of a class.
	- **compound type:** Defined in terms of another type.
	- **const:** Qualifier for objects that cannot be changed (must be initialized).
	- **const pointer:** Pointer that cannot change the object it points to.
	- **const reference:** Reference to a const object.
	- **constant expression:** Evaluated at compile time.
	- **constexpr:** Variable representing a constant expression.
	- **conversion:** Transformation of one type's value to another.
	- **data member:** Data elements within an object.
	- **declaration:** Asserts the existence of a variable, function, or type.
	- **declarator:** Part of a declaration with the name and optional type modifier.
	- **decltype:** Type specifier deduced from a variable or expression.
	- **default initialization:** How objects are initialized without an explicit initializer.
	- **definition:** Allocates storage and optionally initializes a variable.
	- **escape sequence:** Alternative character representation (e.g., \\n for newline).
	- **global scope:** Scope outside any other scope.
	- **header guard:** Preprocessor variable to prevent multiple header inclusions.
	- **identifier:** Sequence of characters forming a name (case-sensitive).
	- **in-class initializer:** Initializer provided within a class data member declaration.
	- **in scope:** Name visible from the current scope.
	- **initialized:** Variable given an initial value when defined.
	- **inner scope:** Scope nested inside another scope.
	- **integral types:** See arithmetic type.
	- **list initialization:** Uses curly braces to enclose multiple initializers.
	- **literal:** Unchangeable value (e.g., number, string).
	- **local scope:** Colloquial term for block scope.
	- **low-level const:** Integral to the type and cannot be ignored.
	- **member:** Part of a class.
	- **nonprintable character:** Character without visible representation (e.g., control character).
	- **null pointer:** Pointer with value 0 (valid but doesn't point to an object).
	- **nullptr:** Literal constant denoting the null pointer.
	- **object:** Region of memory with a type (variable is an object with a name).
	- **outer scope:** Scope enclosing another scope.
	- **pointer:** Object holding an object's address, end-of-object address, or zero.
	- **pointer to const:** Can only point to a const object.
	- **preprocessor:** Program that runs before compilation.
	- **preprocessor variable:** Managed by the preprocessor (replaced before compilation).
	- **reference:** Alias for another object.
	- **reference to const:** Cannot change the object it refers to.
	- **scope:** Portion of program where names have meaning (global, class, namespace, block).
	- **separate compilation:** Splitting a program into multiple source files.
	- **signed:** Integer type holding positive, negative, or zero values.
	- **string:** Library type for variable-length character sequences.
	- **struct:** Keyword used to define a class.
	- **temporary:** Unnamed object created by the compiler during expression evaluation.
	- **top-level const:** Const specifying that an object cannot be changed.
	- **type alias:** A name that is a synonym for another type (defined by typedef or alias declaration).
	- **type checking:** Compiler process verifying object usage consistency with its type definition.
	- **type specifier:** Name of a type.
	- **typedef:** Defines an alias for another type.
	- **undefined:** Usage with no specified meaning in the language (can lead to errors).
	- **uninitialized:** Variable defined without an initial value (accessing it results in undefined behavior).
	- **unsigned:** Integer type holding values greater than or equal to zero.
	- **variable:** Named object or reference (must be declared before use).
	- **void\***: Pointer type that can point to any non-const type (cannot be dereferenced).
	- **void:** Special-purpose type with no operations or value (cannot define variables of this type).
	- **word:** Natural integer computation unit on a machine (usually the size of an address).
	- **& operator:** Address-of operator (yields object's address).
	- **\* operator:** Dereference operator (returns the object pointed to by a pointer).
	- **#define:** Preprocessor directive defining a preprocessor variable.
	- **#endif:** Preprocessor directive ending an #ifdef or #ifndef region.
	- **#ifdef:** Preprocessor directive checking if a variable is defined.
	- **#ifndef:** Preprocessor directive checking if a variable is not defined.
