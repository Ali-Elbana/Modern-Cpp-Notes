**What are Variables?**

Variables are like named containers that store data within your C++ program. They allow you to manipulate that data throughout your code.

**Key Points about Variables:**

- **Type Matters:** Each variable has a specific type (e.g., `int`, `char`, `double`). The type determines:
    - **Size:** Amount of memory the variable occupies (measured in bytes).
    - **Layout:** How the data is arranged within that memory (generally not a major concern for most programmers).
    - **Valid Values:** Range of values the variable can hold (e.g., `int` for integers, `double` for floating-point numbers).
    - **Operations:** The set of actions you can perform on the variable (e.g., addition for numbers, concatenation for strings).

**Terminology:**

C++ programmers often use "variable" and "object" interchangeably.

**Variable Definitions:**

- You define a variable using its type, followed by a list of names separated by commas, and ending with a semicolon.
- Each name in the list has the type you specified.
- Optionally, you can provide an initial value during definition.

**Examples:**

- `int sum = 0, value;` (defines `sum`, `value`, and `units_sold` as integers, with `sum` initialized to 0)
- `Sales_item item;` (defines `item` of type `Sales_item` - more details in Section 1.5.1)
- `std::string book("0-201-78345-X");` (defines `book` of type `std::string` and initializes it with the string literal "0-201-78345-X").

**Object Terminology:**

In C++, "object" generally refers to a memory region with a type. This includes both variables and values of class types. We'll use "object" throughout this notes regardless of the specific type or mutability (read-only vs. changeable) of the data.

### Understanding Initialization

**Giving Variables a Starting Value:**

Variables in C++ can be initialized with a specific value during their creation. This initial value sets the variable's state when the program starts using it.

**Key Points about Initialization:**

- **Initializer Flexibility:** You can use simple values or complex expressions (calculations, function calls, etc.) to initialize variables.
- **Initializer Order Matters (Within a Definition):** When defining multiple variables together, names are usable immediately within the same definition. This allows you to initialize a variable using the value of another variable defined earlier in the same definition.

**Examples:**

- `double price = 109.99, discount = price * 0.16;` (price is defined and used to initialize discount)
- `double salePrice = applyDiscount(price, discount);` (salePrice is initialized using the return value of a function call)

**Initialization vs. Assignment:**

C++ differentiates between initialization and assignment:

- **Initialization:** Assigning a value to a variable during its creation.
- **Assignment:** Changing the value of an already existing variable.

The `=` symbol is used for both operations, but they have distinct purposes. This can be confusing for programmers coming from other languages where the distinction is less strict.

**Why the Distinction Matters:**

Understanding the difference is crucial because initialization sets the initial state, while assignment modifies an existing value. This can affect program behavior, especially with complex data types or memory management.

**Note:** We'll revisit initialization throughout our learning journey in C++ to solidify this important concept.

## <font color="green0">List Initialization</f>

**Multiple Ways to Initialize:**

C++ offers various ways to initialize variables. Here's how you can initialize an `int` named `units_sold` to 0:

1. Traditional Assignment: `int units_sold = 0;`
2. Brace Initialization (New Standard): `int units_sold = {0};`
3. Direct List Initialization: `int units_sold{0};`
4. Parentheses with Initialization (Less Common): `int units_sold(0);`

**Emphasis on Brace Initialization:**

The use of curly braces (`{}`) for initialization (list initialization) is a recent addition to the C++ standard. It allows for more flexible initialization compared to older methods.

**Loss of Information and Built-in Types:**

<font color="red">When initializing built-in types (like `int`) with list initialization, the compiler prevents data loss</f>. Here's an example:

```cpp
long double ld = 3.1415926536;
// These will cause errors (data loss from long double to int)
int a{ld}, b = {ld};  // error: narrowing conversion required
// This compiles but truncates the value
int c(ld), d = ld;    // ok: but value will be truncated
```

Assigning a `long double` to an `int` can lose precision. The compiler rejects `a` and `b` to avoid this data loss. `c` and `d` will compile, but the `long double` value will be truncated to fit the smaller `int` range.

## <font color="green0">Understanding Default Initialization</f>

**What is Default Initialization?**

When you define a variable but don't explicitly assign a value during creation, it undergoes default initialization. The "default" value depends on the variable's type and location within your code.

**Default Values for Built-in Types:**

- **Outside Functions:** Variables defined outside function bodies are initialized to zero by default.
- **Inside Functions:** With rare exceptions, variables defined inside functions are **uninitialized**. This means their value is undefined and unpredictable. Accessing or using such variables can lead to program errors.

**Default Values for Class Types:**

- Each class defines its own default initialization behavior.
- Some classes allow creation without an initializer and provide a default value (e.g., `std::string` initializes to the empty string).
- Other classes might require explicit initialization during creation.

**Examples:**

- `std::string empty;` - `empty` is implicitly initialized to the empty string.
- `Sales_item item;` - `item` is a default-initialized `Sales_item` object (value depends on the `Sales_item` class definition).

**Key Points:**

- Avoid using uninitialized variables inside functions.
- Be aware of class-specific default initialization behavior.

**In summary, understanding default initialization helps you ensure your variables have predictable starting values, avoiding potential errors caused by undefined values.**

## <font color="yellow"><u>Variable Declarations and Definitions:</u></f>

**Separate Compilation and Sharing Code:**

- C++ supports separate compilation, allowing programs to be split into multiple files.
- To share code across files (e.g., using `std::cout` from the standard library), C++ uses declarations and definitions.

**Declarations vs. Definitions:**

- **Declaration:** <font color="red">Makes a name (variable) known but doesn't allocate memory</f>.
    - Used in files that need to use a variable defined elsewhere.
- **Definition:** Creates the variable, allocates storage, and may initialize it.
    - Can be a declaration with an initializer.

**Variable Declarations and Definitions:**

- A variable declaration <font color="red">specifies its type and name</f>.
- A definition includes the type, name, allocates memory, and optionally provides an initial value.
- Use `extern` to declare without defining (no initializer):
    
    ```cpp
    extern int i; // Declaration (no definition)
    ```
    
**`extern` and Initializers:**

- Any declaration with an initializer is a definition.
- <font color="red">Using an initializer with `extern` overrides `extern` and creates a definition</f>:
    
    ```cpp
    extern double pi = 3.1416; // Definition (not declaration)
    ```
    
- Initializers cannot be used with `extern` inside functions (error).

**Multiple Declarations and Single Definition:**

- A variable can be declared multiple times but defined only once.
- Declarations are used in files that need to use the defined variable.

**Uninitialized Variables:**

- Avoid uninitialized variables as they can lead to unpredictable behavior and errors.
- Initialize all variables of built-in types for safety and clarity.

**C++: A Statically Typed Language**

- C++ verifies variable types at compile time (static typing).
- This helps catch errors early and ensures type compatibility for operations.
- Every variable's type must be known to the compiler before use.

**Key Points:**

- Understand the distinction between declarations and definitions for separate compilation.
- Avoid uninitialized variables for predictable program behavior.
- C++ static typing helps identify potential errors during compilation.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Identifiers:</u></f>

### C++ Identifier Naming Rules and Conventions

**Identifiers (Variable Names):**

- Can include letters, digits, and underscore  _ .
- No limit on length, but start with a letter or underscore.
- Case-sensitive (e.g., `age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are different).

**Reserved Names:**

- C++ reserves certain words (keywords) for its own use (listed in Tables 2.3 and 2.4). You cannot use these as variable names.
- The standard library also reserves some names.
- Identifiers shouldn't contain two consecutive underscores (`__`) or start with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter (`_UpperCase`).
- Identifiers defined outside functions shouldn't  start with an underscore (`_`).

**Naming Conventions (for Better Readability):**

- Descriptive: Choose names that reflect the variable's purpose (e.g., `itemCount` instead of `x`).
- Lowercase for variables: Use lowercase letters with underscores to separate words (e.g., `student_name`).
- Uppercase for classes: Class names typically start with an uppercase letter (e.g., `Sales_item`).
- Multi-word names: Separate words visually (e.g., `student_loan` or `studentLoan`, not `studentloan`).

**Consistency is Key:**

Following these conventions consistently improves code readability and maintainability for yourself and others.

**Bonus:**

- Tables 2.3 and 2.4 list reserved keywords and alternative operator names in C++.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Scope of a Name:</u></f>

### Scoping Rules: Where Names Come Alive

In C++, every name you use refers to a specific entity like a variable, function, or type. However, the same name can have different meanings depending on where it's used in your program. This concept is called **scope**.

**What is a Scope?**

Think of a scope as a region of your code where a name has a particular meaning. These regions are typically defined by curly braces `{}`. Names are visible from their point of declaration until the end of the scope they're declared in.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int sum = 0;
  // ... calculate sum ...
  std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this program:

- `main`: Defined outside any braces, it has **global scope**, accessible throughout the program.
- `sum`: Defined within `main`'s body, it has **block scope**, accessible only within `main`.

**Nested Scopes:**

Scopes can nest within each other. Names declared in an outer scope are accessible by inner scopes. However, inner scopes can redefine names from the outer scope.

**Bad Practice Example:**

```cpp
int reused = 42; // reused has global scope

int main()
{
	int unique = 0; // unique has block scope
	
	// output #1: uses global reused; prints 42 0
	std::cout << reused << " " << unique << std::endl;
	
	int reused = 0; // new, local object named reused hides global reused
	
	// output #2: uses local reused; prints0 0
	std::cout << reused << " " << unique << std::endl;
	
	// output #3: explicitly requests the global reused; prints 42 0
	std::cout << ::reused << " " << unique << std::endl;
	
	return 0;
	
}
```

This is bad practice because it can lead to confusion. It's better to avoid reusing names within inner scopes unless absolutely necessary.

**Scope Resolution Operator (::):**

The scope resolution operator `::` allows you to explicitly access a name from a specific scope, even if it's hidden by a local definition. In the example above:

```cpp
std::cout << ::reused << std::endl; // Accesses global reused (42)
```

**Tips:**

- Define variables where you first use them for better readability and easier initialization.
- Avoid reusing names within inner scopes to prevent confusion.

By understanding scope, you can write cleaner and more predictable C++ code!
