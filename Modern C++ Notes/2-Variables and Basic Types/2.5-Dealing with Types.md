## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

As programs grow complex, so do the types we use. These complications stem from two main issues:

1. **Difficult Type Definitions:** Some types have long or error-prone syntax that can be hard to read and write. Additionally, the complexity of the type can obscure its purpose.
2. **Uncertain Type Requirements:** Sometimes, it's challenging to determine the exact type needed in a specific context, requiring analysis of surrounding code.

**Type Aliases to the Rescue**

Type aliases offer a solution by introducing synonyms for existing types. This provides two key benefits:

1. **Simplified Syntax:** Complicated type definitions become easier to use and less error-prone with shorter, clearer aliases.
2. **Improved Readability:** Aliases can emphasize the intended purpose of a type, enhancing code comprehension.

There are two ways to define type aliases in C++:

**1. Using `typedef` (Traditional Method):**

```cpp
typedef double wages;  // wages is an alias for double
typedef wages base, *p;  // base is a synonym for double, p for double*
```

In this approach, `typedef` appears within the declaration and defines aliases rather than variables. Modifiers like `const` can be combined with the base type to create compound types.

**2. Using `using` Declaration (Modern Approach):**

```cpp
using SI = Sales_item;  // SI is a synonym for Sales_item
```

This method starts with `using`, followed by the alias name and an `=`.

**Applying Type Aliases**

Type aliases can be used anywhere a type name would be used:

```cpp
wages hourly, weekly;  // equivalent to double hourly, weekly;
SI item;                // equivalent to Sales_item item;
```

**Pointers, `const`, and Type Aliases: A Nuance**

Using type aliases with compound types and `const` can lead to unexpected results. Consider this example:

```cpp
typedef char *pstring;  // pstring is an alias for char*
const pstring cstr = 0;  // cstr: constant pointer to char
const pstring *ps;      // ps: pointer to a constant pointer to char
```

<font color="red">Here, `pstring` aliases `char*`. The `const` in the base type modifies the entire pointer type, resulting in `cstr` being a constant pointer to `char`, not a pointer to `const char`</font>.

**Beware of Misinterpretations:**

It's tempting to replace the alias with its definition when interpreting a declaration. However, this is incorrect:

```cpp
// Incorrect interpretation:
const char *cstr = 0;  // Wrong interpretation of const pstring cstr
```

In the actual declaration, `pstring` represents a pointer type. Replacing it with `char*` changes the base type to `char`, making `const char` the actual type. This results in a declaration of `cstr` as a pointer to `const char`, which is different from the intended constant pointer to `char`.

**Understanding Variable Initialization:**

Writing programs often involves storing values of expressions in variables. Declaring these variables requires knowing their exact type beforehand. However, determining the type of an expression can be challenging, sometimes even impossible.

**Introducing `auto` for Effortless Type Deduction:**

The C++ standard offers a solution: the `auto` type specifier. Unlike traditional type names like `double`, `auto` empowers the compiler to deduce the type of a variable based on its initializer. This means <font color="red">variables declared with `auto` must have an initializer</font>:

```cpp
auto item = val1 + val2;  // Type of `item` deduced from `val1 + val2`
```

Here, the compiler analyzes the types of `val1` and `val2` during addition (`+`) and assigns the resulting type to `item`. If `val1` and `val2` are `Sales_item` objects, `item` becomes a `Sales_item`.

**Multiple Variable Declarations with `auto`:**

Similar to other type specifiers, `auto` allows declaring multiple variables simultaneously. <font color="red">However, a single base type is permitted per declaration. Therefore, the initializers for all variables must be compatible</font>:

```cpp
auto i = 0, *p = &i;  // OK: i (int) and p (pointer to int) are consistent
auto sz = 0, pi = 3.14; // Error: sz (int) and pi (double) have different types
```

**`auto` with Compound Types, `const`, and Initializers:**

The type inferred by `auto` might not always match the initializer's type exactly. The compiler adjusts it to adhere to standard initialization rules:

1. **References and `auto`:** When an initializer is a reference, the actual object being referenced is used for type deduction:

```cpp
int i = 0, &r = i;
auto a = r;  // a is an int (r refers to i, which has type int)
```

2. **`auto` and Top-Level `const`:** <font color="red">Generally, `auto` ignores top-level `const` (applied to the variable itself). Low-level `const` (applied to the pointed-to object with pointers) is preserved</font>:

```cpp
const int ci = i, &cr = ci;
auto b = ci; // b is an int (top-level const in ci is dropped)
auto c = cr; // c is an int (cr refers to ci, keeping the value but not the const)
auto d = &i; // d is an int* (& of an int object is int*)
auto e = &ci; // e is const int* (& of a const object is low-level const)
```

To explicitly enforce a top-level `const` in the deduced type, use `const auto`:

```cpp
const auto f = ci; // Deduced type of ci is int; f has type const int
```

**References with `auto`:**

Declaring a reference with `auto` follows standard initialization rules:

```cpp
auto &g = ci; // g is a const int& bound to ci
auto &h = 42; // Error: cannot bind a reference to a literal
const auto &j = 42; // OK: const reference can bind to a literal
```

<font color="red">When using a reference with `auto`, top-level `const` in the initializer is not ignored</font>:

```cpp
auto k = ci, &l = i;  // k is int; l is int& (const ignored in references)
```

**Multiple Variable Initializations with `auto`:**

Remember that references and pointers are part of the declarator, not the base type. Consistent deduced types are necessary for initializers in such cases:

```cpp
auto k = ci, &l = i;  // OK: k (int) and l (int&) are compatible
auto &m = ci, *p = &ci;  // OK: m (const int&) and p (const int*) are compatible

// Error: deduced type from i (int) conflicts with deduced type from &ci (const int)
auto &n = i, *p2 = &ci; 
```

## <font color="yellow"><u>The decltype Type Specifier:</u></f>

**What is `decltype`?**

The `decltype` type specifier allows you to define a variable and have the compiler automatically deduce its type based on an expression. However, unlike `auto`, `decltype` doesn't evaluate the expression during type deduction.

**Example:**

```cpp
decltype(f()) sum = x;  // sum has the same type as f() returns
```

Here, the compiler figures out the return type of `f()` and uses that type for `sum`.

**`decltype` and References:**

- When applied to a variable, <font color="red">`decltype` considers top-level `const` and references as part of the type</font>.

```cpp
const int ci = 0, &cj = ci;
decltype(ci) x = 0;  // x is const int
decltype(cj) y = x;  // y is const int& (reference to x)
```

- However, `decltype` on a reference itself returns a reference type. This is the only case where a reference variable isn't treated as a synonym for the object it refers to.

```cpp
decltype(cj) z; // error: z is a reference and needs initialization
```

**`decltype` and Expressions:**

- `decltype` considers expressions that can be assigned to (l-values) and returns <font color="red">a reference type</font>.

```cpp
int i = 42, *p = &i, &r = i;
decltype(r + 0) b;  // b is int (addition is an expression, not a reference)
decltype(*p) c;  // error: c is int& (dereferencing returns an object you can modify)
```

**`decltype` and Parentheses:**

- Parentheses around a variable name change how `decltype` behaves. It treats the expression as an lvalue (modifiable) and returns a reference type.

```cpp
decltype((i)) d;  // d is int& (reference to i, but needs initialization)
decltype(i) e;    // e is int (plain variable name)
```

**Key Takeaways:**

- `decltype` offers more control over type deduction based on expression form.
- It prioritizes the expression's type over the initializer's type (unlike `auto`).
- Understanding `decltype` helps write predictable C++ code, especially with references.
- <font color="red">Assignment expressions yield reference types (reference to the left-hand side type) eg. `decltype(a = b) d = a;`</font>.
