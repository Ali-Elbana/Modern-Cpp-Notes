## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

**What is a const qualifier?**

- Used to define variables whose values cannot be changed after initialization.
- Ensures consistency and prevents accidental modification.

**Example:**

```cpp
const int bufSize = 512; // Defines a constant buffer size
```

**Restrictions on const objects:**

- Cannot be reassigned a new value (e.g., `bufSize = 1024; // Error`).
- Must be initialized during declaration.

**Initializing const objects:**

- Initialization can be done at compile time (e.g., `const int j = 42;`) or runtime (e.g., `const int i = get_size();`).

**Operations on const objects:**

- Can be used in most operations as non-const versions (e.g., arithmetic expressions).
- Cannot be used in operations that modify the object itself.

**Initializing other objects with const objects:**

- You can copy values from const objects to non-const objects (e.g., `int j = ci;`).
- The constness applies only to modifying the const object itself, not the copied value.

**Default Scope of const objects:**

- By default, const objects are local to the file where they are defined.
- For compile-time constant initializers, the compiler replaces the variable with its value during compilation.

**Sharing const objects across files:**

- If the initializer is not a constant expression and you want a single instance across files, use `extern`:
    - Define with `extern` in one file (`.cc`).
    - Declare with `extern` in the header file (`.h`).

**Example:**

```cpp
// file_1.cc (defines and initializes)
extern const int bufSize = fcn();

// file_1.h (declares)
extern const int bufSize;
```

**Important Note:**

- To share a const object across multiple files, you must define it as `extern`.

## <font color="yellow"><u>References to const:</u></f>

**What are references to const?**

- References that refer to constant (`const`) objects.
- Used to create aliases for constant objects.

**Restrictions:**

- Cannot be used to modify the underlying object (e.g., `const int &r1 = ci; r1 = 42; // Error`).

**Example:**

```cpp
const int ci = 1024;
const int &r1 = ci; // Valid: both reference and object are const
```

**Terminology:**

- C++ programmers often abbreviate "reference to const" as "const reference".
- <font color="red">Technically, there are no const references. References themselves are not objects and cannot be const</f>.

**Initializing references to const:**

- A reference to const can be initialized from various sources:
    - Non-const objects (e.g., `int i = 42; const int &r1 = i;`)
    - Literals (e.g., `const int &r2 = 42;`)
    - Expressions convertible to the reference type (e.g., `const int &r3 = r1 * 2;`)

**Key Point:**

- The type of the reference (const or non-const) determines what operations are allowed, not the binding itself.

**Binding to objects of different types:**

- When binding a reference to const to a different type (e.g., `double` to `const int`), <font color="red">the compiler creates a temporary const object of the reference type</f>.
- The reference is then bound to this temporary object.

**Example:**

```cpp
double dval = 3.14;
const int &ri = dval; // Error: directly binding to double
// Compiler transforms to:
const int temp = dval; // Create temporary const int from double (loses precision)
const int &ri = temp; // Bind ri to the temporary
```

**Why non-const references to temporaries are illegal:**

- Imagine `ri` wasn't `const`: `ri = 10;`
- This would modify the temporary object, not the original `dval`. (Unexpected behavior)
- Since references are meant for existing objects, binding a non-const reference to a temporary is disallowed to prevent unintended consequences.

**A reference to const can refer to a non-const object:**

- The reference itself being `const` only restricts modifications through that reference.
- The underlying object can still be modified by other means (e.g., another reference).

**Example:**

```cpp
int i = 42;
const int &r2 = i; // r2 refers to non-const int i
r1 = 0; // Modifying i through r1 (allowed)
r2 = 0; // Error: cannot modify through const reference r2
```

**Summary:**

- References to const provide a safe way to create read-only aliases for objects.
- Understand the distinction between reference type (const/non-const) and object mutability.
- Binding references to const to temporaries is disallowed to avoid unexpected behavior.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Pointers and const:</u></f>

**Pointers to const:**

- Similar to references, pointers can be declared to point to either const or non-const types.
- A pointer to const cannot be used to modify the object it points to.
- We can only store the address of a const object in a pointer to const.

**Example:**

```cpp
const double pi = 3.14; // pi is const (value cannot change)
double *ptr = &pi; // Error: ptr is a non-const pointer (cannot point to const)
const double *cptr = &pi; // OK: cptr can point to a const double
*cptr = 42; // Error: cannot modify the value pointed to by cptr
```

**Key Point:**

- A pointer to const restricts what we can do through the pointer, not whether the underlying object is const itself.

**Exceptions to type matching:**

- We can use a pointer to const to point to a non-const object.
- However, we cannot modify the object's value through the const pointer.

**Example:**

```cpp
double dval = 3.14; // dval is a non-const double
const double *cptr = &dval; // OK: cptr points to dval, but cannot change dval through cptr
```

**Const Pointers:**

- Unlike references, pointers are objects themselves.
- We can have a pointer that is itself const (cannot change the address it holds).
- We declare a const pointer by placing `const` after the asterisk (*).

**Example:**

```cpp
int errNumb = 0;
int *const curErr = &errNumb; // curErr will always point to errNumb
const double pi = 3.14159;
const double *const pip = &pi; // pip is a const pointer to a const object
```

**Reading Const Pointer Declarations:**

- Read from right to left.
- The symbol closest to the pointer variable name (`curErr` or `pip`) defines the const-ness of the pointer itself.
- The remaining declaration defines the type of object the pointer points to.

**Const Pointer vs. Modifying Underlying Object:**

- A const pointer itself being const doesn't restrict modifying the underlying object.
- That depends on the type of the object the pointer points to.

**Example:**

```cpp
*pip = 2.72; // Error: pip is a pointer to const (cannot modify)
*curErr = 0; // OK: curErr points to a non-const int (can modify)
```

**Summary:**

- Pointers to const and const pointers provide mechanisms for controlling mutability in C++.
- Understand the distinction between const-ness of the pointer and the object it points to.
- Use these concepts for safer and more predictable memory management.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Top-Level const:</u></f>

**Understanding `const` with pointers and references is crucial for memory management in C++. This note clarifies the difference between top-level and low-level `const`.**

**Pointers and `const`:**

- A pointer stores a memory address.
    
- `const` with pointers can be applied in two ways:
    
    - **Top-level const:** Makes the pointer itself unmodifiable (cannot change the address it points to).
    - **Low-level const:** Makes the object the pointer points to `const` (cannot modify the value at the pointed-to location).
    

**Example:**

```cpp
int i = 0;
int *const p1 = &i;  // Top-level const: p1 cannot be reassigned another address
const int ci = 42;
const int *p2 = &ci; // Low-level const: cannot modify the value pointed to by p2
```

**Key Points:**

- Pointer types can have both top-level and low-level `const` independently.
- Top-level `const` doesn't affect copying the pointer itself.
- Low-level `const` matters when copying the object pointed to.

**Copying Objects with `const`:**

- When copying objects, top-level `const` is ignored (e.g., copying the value of a `const int` is allowed).
- Low-level `const` compatibility is crucial. <font color="red">You can convert a non-const pointer to a `const` pointer but not vice versa</font>.

**Examples:**

```cpp
const int *p2 = &i; // OK: converting int* to const int* (adding lock)
int *p = p3;        // Error: p3 is const int*, p is not (can't remove lock)

const int &r = ci;  // OK: const int& can refer to a plain int
int &r = ci;        // Error: cannot bind non-const reference (unlocking)
```

**Additional Notes:**

- References can also have `const`, but it always functions as low-level `const`.
- This explanation focuses on basic concepts. Real-world scenarios might involve more complex pointer manipulations.

## <font color="yellow"><u>constexpr and Constant Expressions:</u></f>

**Constant Expressions:**

- Expressions whose values cannot change and can be evaluated at compile time.
- Examples: literals (e.g., `10`), `const` objects initialized by constant expressions (`const int max_files = 20`).

**`constexpr` Variables:**

- Introduced in the new standard to explicitly declare a variable as a constant expression.
- Benefits:
    
    - Compiler verifies the initializer is indeed a constant expression.
    - Improves code readability by clearly stating the intent.
    
- Syntax: `constexpr int mf = 20;` (implicitly `const`)
- Initializer restrictions:
    
    - Must be a constant expression itself.
    - Cannot use ordinary functions (unless defined as `constexpr` functions).
    

**Literal Types:**

- Types suitable for `constexpr` declarations because they are simple enough for compile-time evaluation.
- Examples: arithmetic types, references, pointers (with limitations).
- Non-literal types: classes, library types (e.g., `Sales_item`, `string`).

**Pointers and `constexpr`:**

- `constexpr` applies to the pointer itself, not the pointed-to type.
- Creates two distinct types:
    
    - `const int *p`: pointer to a `const int` (low-level const)
    - `constexpr int *q`: constant pointer to `int` (top-level const)
    
- `constexpr` pointers can point to `const` or non-const types.

**Initialization of `constexpr` Pointers and References:**

- Initializing `constexpr` pointers and references has limitations:
    
    - **Literal values:** You can initialize with `nullptr` or the literal (constant expression) `0`.
    - **Fixed-address objects:** You can point to (or bind to) objects with a fixed memory location throughout the program.
        
        - **Global variables:** Objects defined outside any function have fixed addresses.
        - **Static local variables:** Special local variables within functions that persist across function calls also have fixed addresses.
        
    - **Restrictions:** Local variables inside functions generally don't have fixed addresses and cannot be used with `constexpr` pointers/references.
    

**Key Points:**

- Use `constexpr` for variables intended as constant expressions.
- Literal types ensure compile-time evaluation for `constexpr` declarations.
- Understand the distinction between top-level and low-level const with `constexpr` pointers.
- Be aware of initialization limitations for `constexpr` pointers and references.
