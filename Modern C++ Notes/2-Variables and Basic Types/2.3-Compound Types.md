## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

**Concept:**

- A compound type is a data type defined based on another existing type.

**Examples Covered in this note:**

- References
- Pointers

**Declaring Compound Variables:**

- More complex than simple variable declarations (`type name;`).
- Involves a `base type` followed by a list of `declarators`.
- Each declarator:
    - Names a variable.
    - Defines its type derived from the base type.

**Simple vs. Compound Declarators:**

- **Simple:** Just the variable name (`int x;`). The type is the base type of the declaration.
- **Compound:** Specify variables with types built upon the base type.

## <font color="yellow"><u>References:</u></f>

**What are References?**

- References are alternative names for existing objects.
- They create a direct connection, not a copy, of the original object.

**Declaring References:**

- Use the `&` symbol before the identifier during declaration.
- Example: `int ival = 1024; int &refVal = ival;` (refVal refers to ival)

**Key Points:**

- References must be initialized when declared. (e.g., `int &refVal2; // error`)
- References cannot be re-bound to different objects after initialization.
- References are not objects themselves, but aliases.

**Operations on References:**

- All operations on a reference affect the original object it's bound to.
    - Assigning a value through a reference changes the original object's value.
    - Fetching a value through a reference retrieves the original object's value.

**Restrictions:**

- References cannot be created for references (references to references are not allowed).
- The type of a reference must exactly match the type of the object it refers to (with some exceptions).
- References can only be bound to existing objects, not literals or expressions.

**Example:**

```cpp
int ival = 1024;
int &refVal = ival;

refVal = 2; // Changes the value of ival to 2
int ii = refVal; // ii will also be 2 (same value as ival)
```

**Multiple References:**

- You can define multiple references in one declaration, each with the `&` symbol.
- Example: `int &r = i, r2 = i2;` (r refers to i, r2 is a separate int).

## <font color="yellow"><u>Pointers:</u></f>

**Pointers Explained**

- A pointer is a variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable.
- Unlike references, pointers are separate objects and can be assigned or copied.
- Pointers don't need initialization at declaration (unlike references).
- They can be challenging to understand due to potential errors.

**Declaring Pointers**

- Use `*` before the variable name to define a pointer type:
    - `int *ip` : pointer to an integer
    - `double *dp2` : pointer to a double

**Taking an Object's Address**

- Use the `&` (address-of) operator to get an object's address:
    - `int ival = 42;`
    - `int *p = &ival; // p holds ival's address`

**Pointer Types and Values**

- Pointer types must generally match the object they point to (exceptions exist).
- A pointer value can be:
    1. Pointing to an object.
    2. Pointing just beyond an object's end.
    3. Null (not pointing to any object).
    4. Invalid (undefined behavior if used).

**Accessing an Object Through a Pointer**

- Use the `*` (dereference) operator to access the object a pointer points to:
    - `int *p = &ival;`
    - `cout << *p; // prints 42` (dereference p to get the value)

**Key Points:**

- `&` and `*` can have different meanings depending on context:
    - In declarations (`int *p`), they form pointer types.
    - In expressions (`*p`), they act as address-of and dereference operators.
- Be mindful of pointer validity to avoid undefined behavior.

## <font color="green0">Null pointers</f>

**What are they?**

- Null pointers don't point to any valid object in memory.
- They are used to indicate the absence of a valid memory location.

**How to create them:**

- **Using `nullptr` (modern C++):**
    - Preferred method.
    - `int *p1 = nullptr;`
- **Using literal 0:**
    - `int *p2 = 0;`
- **Using `NULL` (preprocessor macro):**
    - **Discouraged** in modern C++.
    - Requires including `<cstdlib>` header.
    - `int *p3 = NULL;` (equivalent to `0`)

**Why initialize pointers?**

- Uninitialized pointers are a major source of errors.
- Using them can lead to program crashes.
- It's difficult to debug crashes caused by uninitialized pointers.

**Best Practices:**

- Initialize pointers whenever possible.
- If no object to point to, use `nullptr` or `0`.
- This allows the program to detect the absence of a valid object.

**Additional Notes:**

- Don't assign `int` variables to pointers, even if the value is 0.
    - `int zero = 0;`
    - `int *pi = zero; // Error!`
- Preprocessor will be covered later.
- `NULL` is a preprocessor variable, not part of the `std` namespace (no `std::NULL`).

### Pointers vs. References: A Quick Guide

**Indirect Access:**

- Both pointers and references provide indirect access to other objects.
- They act like nicknames or aliases for existing objects.

**Key Differences:**

- **References:**
    - Once created, a reference is permanently bound to a specific object.
    - You cannot change which object a reference refers to.
- **Pointers:**
    - A pointer variable stores the memory address of another object.
    - You can assign a new address to a pointer, making it point to a different object.

**Example:**

```cpp
int i = 42;
int *pi = &i; // pi points to i
int *pi2 = pi; // pi2 now also points to i (both reference the same object)
```

**Assignment:**

- Assigning to a pointer changes the pointer itself (the address it holds).
- Using the dereference operator (*) with a pointer modifies the value of the object the pointer points to.

**Example:**

```cpp
int val = 0;
int *p = &val;
*p = 10; // Changes the value at the memory location pointed to by p (val becomes 10)
p = nullptr; // Now p doesn't point to any object
```

**Null Pointers:**

- A null pointer doesn't point to any valid object.
- It's important to check for null pointers before dereferencing them (using *) to avoid undefined behavior.

**Pointer Comparisons:**

- You can compare pointers of the same type using equality (\==) or inequality (!=) operators.
- Two pointers are equal if they:
    - Both point to the same object.
    - Are both null.
    - Are both one past the end of the same object.

**Important Note:**

- Using an invalid pointer in a condition or comparison can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure pointers are valid before using them in such contexts.
- We will cover additional pointer operations later.

## <font color="green0">Void pointers</f>

**What is a void_ pointer?**

- A special pointer type that can hold the memory address of **any object**, regardless of its data type.
- Unlike regular pointers, it doesn't know the type of data stored at the address it points to.

**Key Points:**

- Can store the address of any data pointer type (`void* pv = &obj;`).
- Can be assigned pointers to different data types (`pv = pd;`).
- Limited operations: compare with other pointers, pass to/return from functions, assign to other void* pointers.
- **Cannot** directly operate on the object it points to due to unknown data type.

**Use Cases:**

- Primarily used for memory management.
- Retrieving the address stored in a void* pointer.

**In essence:**

- Think of void* pointers as tools to manage memory addresses without being concerned about the specific data type stored there.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Understanding Compound Type Declarations:</u></f>

**Key Points:**

- A single variable definition can include multiple variables of different types using base types and declarators (e.g., pointers, references).
- Each declarator can modify the base type differently for its associated variable.
- Don't be confused by whitespace - the type modifier applies only to the variable it's next to.

```cpp
int* p1, p2; // p1 is a pointer to int; p2 is an int
```

**Multiple Variable Definitions:**

- **Style 1:** Place the modifier (*) next to the variable name (emphasizes compound type for each variable).

    ```cpp
    int *p1, *p2; // both p1 and p2 are pointers to int
    ```
    
- **Style 2:** Place the modifier with the type and define one variable per statement (emphasizes defining a compound type).
  
    ```cpp
    int* p1; // p1 is a pointer to int
    int* p2; // p2 is a pointer to int
    ```
    
- Choose a style and use it consistently.

## <font color="green0">Pointers to Pointers</f>

- You can apply multiple type modifiers (\*\*).
- Each * indicates a pointer level (** for pointer to pointer, *** for pointer to pointer to pointer, etc.).
- Dereferencing a pointer to a pointer yields a pointer, requiring double dereferencing to reach the underlying value.

```cpp
int ival = 1024;
int *pi = &ival; // pi points to an int
int **ppi = &pi; // ppi points to a pointer to an int
```

Here pi is a pointer to an int and ppi is a pointer to a pointer to an int. We
might represent these objects as:

## <font color="green0">References to Pointers</f>

- References cannot point to references, but pointers can point to them.
- we can define a reference to a pointer:

	```cpp
	int i = 42;
	int *p; // p is a pointer to int
	int* &r = p; // r is a reference to the pointer p
	r = &i; // r refers to a pointer; assigning &i to r makes p point to i
	*r = 0; // dereferencing r yields i, the object to which p points; changes i to 0
	```
	
- Read reference declarations right to left to understand the type:
    1. Symbol closest to the name defines the most immediate effect (e.g., `&` for reference).
    2. Following symbols define the type the reference refers to (e.g., `*` for pointer type).
    3. Base type defines the final type (e.g., reference to pointer to int).
