## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

#### Key Points:

1. **Definition**:
   - A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task.
   - It can be executed by calling it.

2. **Arguments**:
   - A function may take zero or more arguments.
   - These arguments provide input values for the function's execution.

3. **Return Value**:
   - A function usually yields a result.
   - The result is the output of the function after it completes its task.

4. **Overloading**:
   - Functions can be overloaded.
   - The same function name can refer to multiple different functions with varying parameters.

#### Example:

```cpp
// Function without arguments and return value
void greet() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
}

// Function with arguments and return value
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Overloaded function
double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **greet**:
  - A simple function that prints a greeting.
  - Takes no arguments and has no return value.
- **add (int)**:
  - Takes two integer arguments and returns their sum.
- **add (double)**:
  - Overloaded version of `add`.
  - Takes two double arguments and returns their sum.

#### Summary:

- Functions encapsulate code for specific tasks, making code reusable and modular.
- They can accept arguments and return results.
- Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name to coexist, differentiated by their parameters.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction to Function Basics:</u></f>

#### Key Points:

1. **Function Definition Components**:
   - **Return Type**: Specifies the type of value the function returns.
   - **Name**: Identifies the function.
   - **Parameters**: Zero or more parameters listed in a comma-separated list enclosed in parentheses.
   - **Body**: A statement block that defines the actions the function performs.

2. **Parameters and Arguments**:
   - Parameters are specified in the function definition.
   - Arguments are the values passed to the function when it is called.
   - Arguments are used to initialize the function’s parameters.

3. **Calling a Function**:
   - A function is executed using the call operator `()`.
   - The call operator takes an expression that is a function or a pointer to a function.
   - Inside the parentheses is a comma-separated list of arguments.

4. **Return Type of a Call Expression**:
   - The type of a call expression matches the return type of the function.

#### Example:

```cpp
// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Calling the function
int sum = add(5, 3); // sum is initialized to 8
```

#### Summary:

- **Function Definition**: Return type, name, parameters, and body.
- **Call Operator**: `()` used to execute a function with arguments.
- **Return Type**: The type of the value returned by the function. 

Functions encapsulate reusable logic and are fundamental building blocks in C++ programming.

### <font color="green0">Writing a Function</f>

#### Key Points:

1. **Factorial Definition**:
   - The factorial of a number \( n \) is the product of all integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - Example: \( 5! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \).

2. **Function Definition**:
   - Define a function `fact` to calculate the factorial of a given number.

3. **Function Implementation**:

   - **Function Signature**:
   
     ```cpp
     int fact(int val)
     ```
     
   - **Local Variable**:
     - `int ret = 1;` // To hold the intermediate result.

   - **While Loop**:
     - Compute the factorial by multiplying `ret` with `val` and then decrementing `val`.
     - Use the postfix decrement operator (`val--`).

   - **Return Statement**:
     - Return the final result stored in `ret`.

4. **Code Example**:
    
   ```cpp
   // Factorial of val is val * (val - 1) * (val - 2) . . . * ((val - (val - 1)) * 1)
   int fact(int val)
   {
       int ret = 1; // Local variable to hold the result as we calculate it
       while (val > 1)
           ret *= val--; // Assign ret * val to ret and decrement val
       return ret; // Return the result
   }
   ```

5. **Explanation**:
   - **Function Name**: `fact`
   - **Parameter**: Takes one integer `val`.
   - **Return Type**: Returns an integer.
   - **Logic**:
     - Initialize `ret` to 1.
     - Multiply `ret` by `val` and decrement `val` in each iteration of the `while` loop.
     - Continue until `val` is greater than 1.
     - Return the calculated factorial stored in `ret`.

#### Summary:

- The `fact` function calculates the factorial of an integer using a `while` loop and the postfix decrement operator.
- The result is stored in a local variable `ret` and returned at the end of the function.

This example demonstrates a straightforward implementation of a factorial function in C++.

### <font color="green0">Calling a Function</f>

#### Key Points:

1. **Function Call Basics**:
   - A function call requires supplying arguments that match the function's parameters.
   - The result of the function call is typically assigned to a variable or used in an expression.

2. **Example**:
   - Calling the `fact` function:
     
     ```cpp
     int main() {
         int j = fact(5); // j equals 120, i.e., the result of fact(5)
         cout << "5! is " << j << endl;
         return 0;
     }
     ```
     
   - **Explanation**:
     - `fact(5)` calculates the factorial of 5.
     - The result, 120, is stored in `j`.
     - The program outputs "5! is 120".

3. **Function Call Mechanics**:
   - A function call involves:
     1. **Initializing Parameters**: The function’s parameters are initialized with the provided arguments.
     2. **Transferring Control**: Control is transferred from the **calling** function to the **called** function.
   - The calling function pauses while the called function executes.

4. **Function Execution**:
   - Execution starts with initializing parameters:
     - In `fact`, an `int` variable named `val` is created and initialized with the argument value (e.g., 5).
   - Execution ends with a `return` statement:
     1. **Returning Value**: The value (if any) in the `return` statement is returned.
     2. **Transferring Control**: Control is transferred back to the calling function.
   - The returned value initializes the result of the call expression.

5. **Detailed Example**:
   - The call `fact(5)` can be broken down as:
     
     ```cpp
     int val = 5; // initialize val from the literal 5
     int ret = 1; // code from the body of fact
     while (val > 1)
         ret *= val--;
     int j = ret; // initialize j as a copy of ret
     ```
     
   - **Explanation**:
     - `val` is initialized to 5.
     - `ret` is initialized to 1.
     - A `while` loop calculates the factorial:
       - `ret` is multiplied by `val` and `val` is decremented until `val` is no longer greater than 1.
     - `j` is assigned the value of `ret`, which is 120.

#### Summary:

- A function call initializes the function's parameters and transfers control to the called function.
- Execution of the calling function is paused while the called function runs.
- When the called function returns, control transfers back, and the returned value initializes the result of the call expression.

### <font color="green0">Parameters and Arguments</f>

- **Definition**:
  - **Parameters**: Variables defined by a function that receive values when the function is called.
  - **Arguments**: The actual values passed to the function's parameters when it is called.

- **Initialization**:
  - Each argument initializes its corresponding parameter in sequence (first argument for the first parameter, second argument for the second parameter, and so on).
  - The order of evaluation of arguments is not guaranteed and is determined by the compiler.

- **Type Matching**:
  - The type of each argument must match the type of its corresponding parameter.
  - This is similar to how an initializer's type must match the type of the object it initializes.

- **Number of Arguments**:
  - The number of arguments passed must exactly match the number of parameters the function expects.
  - Mismatched argument counts lead to compilation errors.

- **Examples**:
  ```cpp
  int fact(int); // function prototype with a single int parameter

  fact("hello"); // error: wrong argument type (no conversion from const char* to int)
  fact(); // error: too few arguments
  fact(42, 10, 0); // error: too many arguments
  fact(3.14); // ok: argument is converted to int (truncation to 3)
  ```

- **Explanation of Examples**:
  - `fact("hello");`
    - Error because `const char*` cannot be converted to `int`.
  - `fact();`
    - Error due to too few arguments.
  - `fact(42, 10, 0);`
    - Error due to too many arguments.
  - `fact(3.14);`
    - Valid: `double` is implicitly converted to `int` (3.14 truncated to 3).
    - Equivalent call after conversion: `fact(3);`

### <font color="green0">Function Parameter List</f>

- **Empty Parameter List**:
  - A function's parameter list can be empty but cannot be omitted.
  - Define a function with no parameters by writing an empty parameter list:
    ```cpp
    void f1() { /* . . . */ } // implicit void parameter list
    void f2(void) { /* . . . */ } // explicit void parameter list for compatibility with C
    ```

- **Parameter List Composition**:
  - Typically consists of a comma-separated list of parameters.
  - Each parameter looks like a declaration with a single declarator.
  - Even if the types of two parameters are the same, the type must be repeated:
    ```cpp
    int f3(int v1, v2) { /* . . . */ } // error
    int f4(int v1, int v2) { /* . . . */ } // ok
    ```

- **Parameter Naming Rules**:

  - No two parameters can have the same name.

```cpp
// Invalid function: Two parameters with the same name
void example(int a, int a) {
    // function body
}
```

  - Local variables at the outermost scope of the function cannot have the same name as any parameter.

```cpp
// Invalid function: Local variable 'a' has the same name as a parameter
void example(int a) {
    int a = 10; // Error: redeclaration of 'a'
    // function body
}

```

- **Unnamed Parameters**:

  - Parameter names are optional, but there is no way to use an unnamed parameter.

```cpp
// Valid function: Unused parameter is left unnamed
void example(int, double) {
    // function body does not use the parameters
}

```

  - Parameters ordinarily have names, even if not used.

  - Leaving a parameter unnamed indicates it isn't used, but it does not change the number of arguments that a call must supply.

```cpp
// Valid function: Unnamed parameter indicates it is not used
void example(int, double) {
    // function body does not use the parameters
}

```

  - A call must supply an argument for every parameter, even if that parameter isn’t used.

```cpp
// Function definition with unused parameters
void example(int, double) {
    // function body does not use the parameters
}

int main() {
    example(10, 3.14); // Valid call, arguments provided for all parameters
    return 0;
}
```

### <font color="green0">Function Return Type</f>

1. **General Rule**:
    - Most types can be used as the return type of a function.
    - Special Case: The return type can be `void`, indicating the function does not return a value.

2. **Exceptions**:
    - The return type **cannot** be an array type.
    - The return type **cannot** be a function type.

3. **Returning Pointers**:
    - A function can return a pointer to an array.
    - A function can return a pointer to a function.

## <font color="yellow">Local Objects</f>

**Scope and Lifetime**
- **Scope**: The part of the program's text where a name (variable, function, etc.) is visible.
- **Lifetime**: The duration during the program's execution that an object exists.

**Function Scope**
- A function body is a statement block that forms a new scope.
- Variables defined within this block are called local variables.
- Local variables are specific to that function and can hide declarations of the same name in an outer scope.

**Global Objects**
- Objects defined outside any function have a global scope.
- These objects are created when the program starts and exist throughout the program's execution.
- They are not destroyed until the program ends.

**Local Variables' Lifetime**
- The lifetime of a local variable depends on its definition.
- Typically, local variables are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits.

#### Key Points

- **Scope**: Determines where a name is visible.
- **Lifetime**: Determines how long an object exists during execution.
- **Local Variables**: Exist within the scope of a function and can hide outer scope declarations.
- **Global Objects**: Persist for the entire duration of the program.

### <font color="green0">Automatic Objects</f>

**Definition and Lifecycle:**

- **Creation:** 
  - Automatic objects are created when the function's control path passes through the variable’s definition.
- **Destruction:** 
  - These objects are destroyed when control passes through the end of the block in which the variable is defined.
- **Scope:** 
  - Objects that exist only while a block is executing are known as automatic objects.
  - After execution exits a block, the values of the automatic objects created in that block are undefined.

**Parameters as Automatic Objects:**

- **Storage Allocation:** 
  - Storage for the parameters is allocated when the function begins.
- **Scope and Lifetime:** 
  - Parameters are defined in the scope of the function body and are destroyed when the function terminates.
- **Initialization:** 
  - Automatic objects corresponding to the function’s parameters are initialized by the arguments passed to the function.

**Local Variables as Automatic Objects:**

- **Initialization:**
  - Automatic objects corresponding to local variables are initialized if their definition contains an initializer.
  - Otherwise, they are default initialized, which means that uninitialized local variables of built-in type have undefined values.

**Key Points:**

- **Automatic Objects:**
  - Created and destroyed within a block’s scope.
  - Undefined values after block execution.
- **Function Parameters:**
  - Allocated at function start, destroyed at function end.
  - Initialized by function arguments.
- **Local Variables:**
  - Initialized by definition or default initialized.
  - Uninitialized built-in types have undefined values.

### <font color="green0">Local static Objects</f>

**Definition and Use Case:**
- **Local Static Object:** A local variable whose lifetime extends across multiple calls to the function in which it is defined. This is achieved by declaring the local variable as `static`.

**Initialization and Lifetime:**
- **Initialization:** A local static object is initialized only once, before the first time execution reaches its definition.
- **Lifetime:** Unlike regular local variables, local static objects are not destroyed when the function exits. They remain in existence until the program terminates.

**Example and Explanation:**

```cpp
size_t count_calls()
{
    static size_t ctr = 0; // value will persist across calls
    return ++ctr;
}

int main()
{
    for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
        cout << count_calls() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

- **Program Output:** This program prints the numbers from 1 to 10.
- **Working:**
  - Before the first call to `count_calls`, the local static variable `ctr` is created and initialized to 0.
  - Each call to `count_calls` increments `ctr` and returns its new value.
  - The value of `ctr` is preserved across function calls, meaning that on each subsequent call, `ctr` continues from its last value.

**Behavior Without Explicit Initializer:**
- If a local static variable has no explicit initializer, it is **value initialized**:
  - For built-in types, this means it is initialized to zero.

**Key Points:**
- Local static variables are useful for maintaining state information across function calls.
- They are initialized only once and retain their value between function invocations.
- They provide a simple way to count function calls, manage state information, and more.

**Summary:**
Local static objects in C++ are powerful tools for maintaining state across multiple function calls. They ensure that a variable is initialized once and persists until the program ends, making them ideal for functions that need to retain information between calls.

## <font color="yellow">Function Declarations</f>

#### Overview:

- **Function Declaration Requirement**: Similar to variables, a function must be declared before it can be used.
- **Definition vs. Declaration**: 
  - A function may be defined only once.
  - A function can be declared multiple times.

#### Usage Rules:

- **Undeclared Functions**: We can declare a function that is not defined as long as we never use that function.

#### Syntax:

- **Function Declaration vs. Definition**:
  - **Declaration**: No function body; a semicolon replaces the function body.
  - **Definition**: Includes the function body.
  
- **Parameter Names**:
  - Not required in a declaration.
  - Can be included for clarity to help understand what the function does.

#### Example:

```cpp
// Parameter names indicate that the iterators denote a range of values to print
void print(vector<int>::const_iterator beg, vector<int>::const_iterator end);
```

#### Key Components of a Function Declaration:

- **Return Type**
- **Function Name**
- **Parameter Types**

These elements define the function's interface and provide all the necessary information to call the function.

#### Terminology:

- **Function Declaration**: Also known as the **function prototype**.

### <font color="green0">Function Declarations Go in Header Files</f>

### Notes: Function Declarations Go in Header Files

1. **Variable and Function Declaration Location**
   - Variables are declared in header files and defined in source files.
   - Similarly, functions should be declared in header files and defined in source files.

2. **Temptation to Declare in Source Files**
   - It is legal but tedious and error-prone to put a function declaration directly in each source file that uses the function.
   - This approach can lead to inconsistencies and errors.

3. **Advantages of Using Header Files**
   - Ensures all declarations for a given function are consistent.
   - If the function interface changes, only the declaration in the header file needs to be updated.

4. **Source File Inclusions**
   - The source file that defines a function should include the header that contains the function’s declaration.
   - This practice allows the compiler to verify that the function's definition and declaration are consistent.

5. **Best Practice**
   - Always include the header that declares a function in the source file that defines that function to ensure consistency and facilitate maintenance.

## <font color="yellow">Separate Compliation</f>

**Concept Overview:**
- **Separate Compilation:** 
  - C++ supports the concept of separate compilation, which allows programs to be divided into multiple files.
  - Each file can be compiled independently, facilitating modular development.

**Benefits:**
- **Modularity:**
  - Helps in organizing code by separating different parts of the program into distinct files.
  - Functions and related code can be stored in specific files, making the program easier to manage and understand.

- **Parallel Development:**
  - Different parts of the program can be developed and compiled simultaneously by different team members.

- **Efficiency:**
  - Only modified files need to be recompiled, saving time during the build process.

**Example Use Case:**
- **Exercises from § 6.1 (p. 205):**
  - Functions written for the exercises can be stored in one file.
  - Code that uses these functions can be stored in other source files.

**Implementation:**
- **Header Files (.h or .hpp):**
  - Used to declare functions, classes, and other entities.
  - Ensure that declarations are available to multiple source files.

- **Source Files (.cpp):**
  - Contain the actual definitions and implementations.
  - Can include header files to access declarations.

**Compilation Process:**
1. **Compile Each Source File:**
   - Each source file is compiled into an object file (.o or .obj).
2. **Link Object Files:**
   - Object files are linked together to create the final executable.

By understanding and utilizing separate compilation, you can effectively manage and scale your C++ programs, ensuring better organization and faster development cycles.

### <font color="green0">Compiling and Linking Multiple Source Files</f>

#### Example Scenario:

- **Definition file**: `fact.cc` (contains the definition of `fact` function)
- **Header file**: `Chapter6.h` (contains the declaration of `fact` function)
- **Main file**: `factMain.cc` (contains the `main` function that calls `fact`)

#### Steps to Compile and Link:

1. **Compile and Link Together**:

   ```bash
   $ CC factMain.cc fact.cc # generates factMain.exe or a.out
   $ CC factMain.cc fact.cc -o main # generates main or main.exe
   ```
   
   - `CC`: Compiler name
   - `$`: System prompt
   - `#`: Command-line comment

2. **Running the Executable**:
   - The generated executable (e.g., `factMain.exe` or `main`) runs the `main` function.

#### Recompiling Changed Files:

- When only one source file changes, <font color="red">you can recompile only the changed file to save time</font>.

#### Separate Compilation:

- Most compilers allow separate compilation of source files, generating object files (`.obj` on Windows or `.o` on UNIX).

1. **Compile Separately**:

   ```bash
   $ CC -c factMain.cc # generates factMain.o
   $ CC -c fact.cc # generates fact.o
   ```

2. **Link Object Files**:

   ```bash
   $ CC factMain.o fact.o # generates factMain.exe or a.out
   $ CC factMain.o fact.o -o main # generates main or main.exe
   ```

#### Notes:

- Check your compiler’s user guide for specific instructions on compiling and linking multiple source files.
- Object files (`.o` or `.obj`) contain object code, which is linked together to form an executable.

#### Summary:

- **Compiling and Linking**: You can compile and link multiple source files in one step or separately.
- **Efficiency**: Separate compilation is efficient for modifying and recompiling only changed files.
- **Executable Creation**: Linking object files creates the final executable.
