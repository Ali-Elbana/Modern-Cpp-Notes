## <font color="yellow"><u>Default Arguments:</u></f>

#### 1. Definition
- **Purpose**: Default arguments allow parameters in function calls to take a default value if the caller does not provide one.
- **Usage Example**:
  ```cpp
  typedef string::size_type sz;
  string screen(sz ht = 24, sz wid = 80, char backgrnd = ' ');
  ```
  - **Default values**: Height (ht), width (wid), and background character (backgrnd) are given default values.
  - **Key Rule**: Parameters with default values must appear last in the parameter list.
  
#### 2. Calling Functions with Default Arguments
- If you omit arguments, the function uses the default value for the missing ones:
  ```cpp
  window = screen();           // Equivalent to screen(24, 80, ' ')
  window = screen(66);         // Equivalent to screen(66, 80, ' ')
  window = screen(66, 256);    // Equivalent to screen(66, 256, ' ')
  window = screen(66, 256, '#'); // screen(66, 256, '#')
  ```
- **Key Rule**: You can only omit *trailing* arguments. Skipping non-trailing arguments results in an error.

#### 3. Argument Resolution by Position
- Arguments are matched by their position in the parameter list.
  ```cpp
  window = screen('?' );  // Legal but unintended, as '?' converts to an integer.
  ```
- The `'?'` is implicitly converted to `string::size_type`, which can lead to unintended results. In this case, it passes `63` as the height.

#### 4. Designing Functions with Default Arguments
- Place parameters that are less likely to use default values at the beginning.
- Parameters with default values should appear toward the end.

#### 5. Default Argument Declarations
- **Key Rule**: Default arguments should be declared only once in a given scope.
  ```cpp
  string screen(sz, sz, char = ' ');  // Declares default only for char.
  string screen(sz = 24, sz = 80, char);  // Adds default for sz parameters.
  ```
- You **cannot** redeclare an existing default argument:
  ```cpp
  string screen(sz, sz, char = '*'); // Error: redeclaration.
  ```

#### 6. Default Argument Initializers
- **Restrictions**: Local variables cannot be used as default arguments, but expressions convertible to the parameter type can be used.
  ```cpp
  sz wd = 80;
  char def = ' ';
  sz ht();
  string screen(sz = ht(), sz = wd, char = def);
  string window = screen();  // calls screen(ht(), 80, ' ')
  ```
  
- **Key Concept**: Default argument values are evaluated at the time of the function call.
  ```cpp
  void f2() {
      def = '*'; // Changes the default argument value.
      sz wd = 100; // Hides the outer wd but does not change the default.
      window = screen();  // Calls screen(ht(), 80, '*')
  }
  ```

## <font color="yellow"><u>Inline and `constexpr` Functions:</u></f>

#### 1. Benefits of Defining Small Functions
- **Readability**: It's easier to understand a function call like `shorterString(s1, s2)` than a complex conditional expression.
- **Consistency**: A function ensures uniform behavior in how tests or operations are performed.
- **Maintainability**: Changes are centralized in the function rather than multiple occurrences of similar code.
- **Reusability**: The function can be reused in other parts of the program without rewriting the logic.

#### 2. Drawback: Function Call Overhead
- Calling a function incurs overhead like saving/restoring registers, copying arguments, and branching to a new location.
- For small operations, the overhead may make function calls slower than using equivalent expressions directly.

### 4. Inline Functions

#### Purpose:
- **Avoid Function Call Overhead**: An `inline` function is expanded "in-line" at each call site, avoiding the overhead of a function call.
  
#### Example:  
If `shorterString` is defined as `inline`,  
```cpp
inline const string & shorterString(const string &s1, const string &s2) {
    return s1.size() <= s2.size() ? s1 : s2;
}
```
A call like `cout << shorterString(s1, s2) << endl;` would be expanded at compile time to:
```cpp
cout << (s1.size() < s2.size() ? s1 : s2) << endl;
```
This removes the function call overhead.

#### Characteristics:
- The `inline` keyword is a **suggestion** to the compiler, which can choose to ignore it.
- **Best suited** for small, straight-line functions that are called frequently.
- **Recursion**: Most compilers won't inline recursive functions.
- Large functions (e.g., 75 lines) are unlikely to be inlined.

### 5. `constexpr` Functions

#### Purpose:
- A `constexpr` function can be used in **constant expressions** and is evaluated at compile time if possible.

#### Example:
```cpp
constexpr int new_sz() { return 42; }
constexpr int foo = new_sz(); // ok: foo is a constant expression
```
- The compiler verifies that `new_sz()` returns a constant expression, allowing `foo` to be initialized with it at compile time.

#### Characteristics:
- The return type and parameter types must be **literal types**.
- The body must contain **exactly one return statement**.
  
#### `constexpr` Function with Arguments:
```cpp
constexpr size_t scale(size_t cnt) { return new_sz() * cnt; }
```
- If the argument to `scale` is a constant expression, the return value is also a constant expression:
  ```cpp
  int arr[scale(2)]; // ok: scale(2) is a constant expression
  int i = 2;
  int a2[scale(i)]; // error: scale(i) is not a constant expression
  ```

- **Flexibility**: A `constexpr` function **is not required** to return a constant expression; it can return a non-constant value depending on its arguments.

#### Implicit Inline:
- `constexpr` functions are **implicitly inline**, meaning they don't incur function call overhead.

### 6. Defining Inline and `constexpr` Functions in Header Files
- **Multiple Definitions**: Unlike regular functions, `inline` and `constexpr` functions can be defined multiple times in a program because the compiler needs access to the full definition to expand them.
- **Best Practice**: They are usually defined in **header files** to ensure consistency and allow for inlining across multiple translation units.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Aids for Debugging:</u></f>

#### 1. Debugging During Development
- C++ developers often include debugging code that is only executed during development.
- This code is disabled when the program is complete and ready to ship.
- The conditional execution of debugging code is managed using two preprocessor facilities:
  1. **assert** macro
  2. **NDEBUG** preprocessor variable

### 2. The `assert` Preprocessor Macro
- **Purpose**: Checks conditions during runtime and aids in debugging.
- **Behavior**: 
  - `assert(expr);` evaluates `expr`. 
  - If `expr` is false (zero), `assert` writes a message and terminates the program.
  - If `expr` is true (non-zero), `assert` does nothing.
- **Usage**:
  - Defined in the `cassert` header.
  - `assert` is a preprocessor macro, not a standard function; itâ€™s referred to directly as `assert` (not `std::assert`), and no `using` declaration is needed.
  - Macro names must be unique, meaning `assert` should not be used for any other purpose, even if `cassert` is not explicitly included (other headers may include it).
#### Example:
```cpp
assert(word.size() > threshold);
```
- This checks if the size of the word is greater than the threshold.

### 3. The `NDEBUG` Preprocessor Variable
- **Purpose**: Controls whether `assert` checks are enabled.
  - If `NDEBUG` is **defined**, `assert` does nothing.
  - If `NDEBUG` is **not defined** (default), `assert` performs runtime checks.
  
- **Usage**:
  - Define `NDEBUG` using a `#define` or through a compiler option.
  - Example of defining `NDEBUG` during compilation:
    ```bash
    $ CC -D NDEBUG main.C
    ```
  
- **Caution**: `assert` should only be used for conditions that "cannot happen." It is not meant to replace runtime error handling.

### 4. Writing Custom Debugging Code
- Conditional debugging code can be written using `NDEBUG` with `#ifndef` and `#endif`:
  
```cpp
void print(const int ia[], size_t size) {
    #ifndef NDEBUG
        cerr << __func__ << ": array size is " << size << endl;
    #endif
    // ... 
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - If `NDEBUG` is **not defined**, the code inside `#ifndef` will be executed. If `NDEBUG` is **defined**, it will be ignored.
  
### 5. Preprocessor-Defined Variables for Debugging
The preprocessor defines several useful variables for debugging purposes:
  - **`__FILE__`**: Contains the name of the file as a string.
  - **`__LINE__`**: Holds the current line number as an integer.
  - **`__TIME__`**: Contains the time the file was compiled as a string.
  - **`__DATE__`**: Contains the date the file was compiled as a string.
  - **`__func__`**: A static local variable holding the name of the current function.
  
#### Example Debugging Code:
```cpp
if (word.size() < threshold)
    cerr << "Error: " << __FILE__
         << " : in function " << __func__
         << " at line " << __LINE__ << endl
         << " Compiled on " << __DATE__
         << " at " << __TIME__ << endl
         << " Word read was \"" << word
         << "\": Length too short" << endl;
```

#### Example Output:
```
Error: wdebug.cc : in function main at line 27
Compiled on Jul 11 2012 at 20:50:03
Word read was "foo": Length too short
```

This error message includes useful information such as the file name, function, line number, compilation time, and the problematic word.
