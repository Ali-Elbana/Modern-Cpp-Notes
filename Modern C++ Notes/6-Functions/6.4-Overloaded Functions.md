## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

#### 1. **Definition of Overloaded Functions:**
   - Functions that share the same name but have **different parameter lists** are called *overloaded functions*.
   - These functions must appear in the **same scope**.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     void print(const char *cp);
     void print(const int *beg, const int *end);
     void print(const int ia[], size_t size);
     ```
     Here, all functions have the same name (`print`) but differ in their parameters.

#### 2. **Purpose of Overloading:**
   - Overloading allows functions to perform **similar actions** on **different types of parameters**.
   - The compiler determines which version of the function to invoke based on the types of the arguments passed.

#### 3. **Function Calls and Overload Resolution:**
   - The compiler selects the appropriate function by **matching the argument type** to the corresponding overloaded function:
     ```cpp
     int j[2] = {0, 1};
     print("Hello World");                // Calls print(const char*)
     print(j, end(j) - begin(j));         // Calls print(const int*, size_t)
     print(begin(j), end(j));             // Calls print(const int*, const int*)
     ```

#### 4. **Benefit of Function Overloading:**
   - Overloading reduces the need for creating multiple function names for similar tasks, which simplifies the code and makes it more readable.
   - It eliminates the need to create unique names just to distinguish between different functions for the compiler's sake.

#### 5. **Limitations:**
   - The **main function** cannot be overloaded.

### <font color="green0">Defining Overloaded Functions</f>

- **Example Scenario**:
  - In a database application, you might have several functions for searching records based on different criteria:
    ```cpp
    Record lookup(const Account&); // find by Account
    Record lookup(const Phone&);   // find by Phone
    Record lookup(const Name&);    // find by Name
    ```
  - These functions are all named `lookup` but handle different types of inputs (e.g., `Account`, `Phone`, or `Name`).

- **Function Call**:
  - The compiler determines which function to call based on the argument type passed:
    ```cpp
    Account acct;
    Phone phone;
    Record r1 = lookup(acct);   // Calls lookup with Account
    Record r2 = lookup(phone);  // Calls lookup with Phone
    ```

- **Key Points on Overloading**:
  - The **parameter types** or the **number of parameters** must be different for overloaded functions to be valid.
  - **Return type alone** is **not sufficient** to distinguish overloaded functions. For example:
    ```cpp
    Record lookup(const Account&);
    bool lookup(const Account&); // Error: same parameter list, different return types
    ```
  - Having two functions with identical parameter lists but differing only in return type will result in a compilation error.

### <font color="green0">Determining Whether Two Parameter Types Differ</f>

#### 1. **Parameter List Equivalence**  
   - Two parameter lists can be identical even if they look different. The function declarations may vary in syntax, but this doesn't mean the functions themselves are different.
   
#### 2. **Parameter Names Are Ignored**  
   - Parameter names in a function declaration serve only as documentation and do not affect the function's parameter list:
     ```cpp
     Record lookup(const Account &acct);
     Record lookup(const Account&);
     ```
   - Both functions above declare the same function, even though one names the parameter (`acct`) and the other omits it. The names are irrelevant in matching parameter lists.

#### 3. **Type Aliases Do Not Create New Types**  
   - When using type aliases, the alias is merely another name for an existing type. It does not introduce a new type:
     ```cpp
     typedef Phone Telno;
     Record lookup(const Phone&);
     Record lookup(const Telno&);
     ```
   - In this case, both declarations refer to the same type (`Phone`). Even though one uses `Phone` and the other uses the alias `Telno`, the parameter lists are considered identical.  

#### 4. **Conclusion**  
   - Function parameter types are considered the same if:
     - The difference is solely in the parameter names.
     - The types differ only due to the use of a type alias, as aliases are not distinct types but simply alternative names for existing ones.

### <font color="green0">Overloading and const Parameters</f>

#### 1. **Top-level `const` Parameters**:
   - **Top-level `const`** has no effect on the function signature. It applies to the parameter itself and does not distinguish between two function declarations.
     - Example:
       ```cpp
       Record lookup(Phone);
       Record lookup(const Phone); // redeclares Record lookup(Phone)
       Record lookup(Phone*);
       Record lookup(Phone* const); // redeclares Record lookup(Phone*)
       ```
   - In these cases, the `const` keyword is top-level, meaning it applies to the object itself but not to the type or the underlying data being referenced. This makes these functions identical in signature.

#### 2. **Low-level `const` and Overloading**:
   - **Low-level `const`** refers to the `const` qualifier when used with pointers or references, affecting the type being pointed to or referenced.
   - Functions can be overloaded based on whether the parameter is a reference or pointer to a `const` or non-`const` version of a type.
     - Example:
       ```cpp
       // Overloaded functions based on constness of references/pointers
       Record lookup(Account&);            // reference to non-const Account
       Record lookup(const Account&);      // reference to const Account
       Record lookup(Account*);            // pointer to non-const Account
       Record lookup(const Account*);      // pointer to const Account
       ```
   - These are **four distinct overloaded functions**. The compiler uses the constness of the argument to determine which function to call.

#### 3. **Rules for Calling Functions with `const` Parameters**:
   - **Const Arguments**: A `const` object or pointer to `const` can only be passed to the corresponding function that accepts a `const` parameter.
   - **Non-const Arguments**: A non-const object or pointer to non-const can be passed to either the non-const or const versions of the function. However, the compiler prefers the **non-const version** when available.
     - There is **no implicit conversion from non-const to const**, but there is a conversion from const to non-const when passing objects or pointers.

#### 4. **Function Resolution Preference**:
   - The compiler will favor calling the **non-const version** of an overloaded function when a non-const object or pointer is passed. This ensures that modifications to the non-const object can occur if needed.

### <font color="green0">const_cast and Overloading</f>

- `const_cast` is primarily useful in function overloading scenarios.
- Consider a function, `shorterString`, that returns the shorter of two `const string&`:
    ```cpp
    const string& shorterString(const string& s1, const string& s2) {
        return s1.size() <= s2.size() ? s1 : s2;
    }
    ```
    - This function works for `nonconst` string arguments, but it returns a reference to a `const string`.
    - A `nonconst` reference might be desired in cases where the input arguments are non-constant.
  
- A second version can be written using `const_cast` to handle `nonconst` strings:
    ```cpp
    string& shorterString(string& s1, string& s2) {
        auto& r = shorterString(const_cast<const string&>(s1), const_cast<const string&>(s2));
        return const_cast<string&>(r);
    }
    ```
    - This version casts the `nonconst` strings to `const` to call the `const` version of the function.
    - After getting a reference to `const string` from the first function, the `const_cast` is used again to cast the result back to `nonconst string&` before returning it.
    - This is safe because the returned reference points to one of the original `nonconst` arguments.


 ### <font color="orange">Advice: When Not to Overload Function Names:</font>
- Overloading can help avoid inventing new names for similar operations, but it should only be done when functions truly perform **similar tasks**.
- In some cases, different names can provide **better clarity** in a program.
  
- Example with a cursor movement function:
    ```cpp
    Screen& moveHome();
    Screen& moveAbs(int, int);
    Screen& moveRel(int, int, string direction);
    ```
    - Here, `moveHome` represents a distinct action compared to other cursor movements.
    - Overloading the `move` function might obscure the unique actions performed by each variant:
        ```cpp
        Screen& move();
        Screen& move(int, int);
        Screen& move(int, int, string direction);
        ```
    - By overloading, we lose the explicit meaning that was conveyed by specific function names (`moveHome`, `moveAbs`, etc.).
  
- Whether to overload or use distinct names depends on **code readability**:
    - Example:
        ```cpp
        myScreen.moveHome();   // Clear and easy to understand
        myScreen.move();       // Less clear, requires context to understand what 'move' does
        ```

    - **Best practice**: Avoid overloading when different function names make the program easier to understand.**

### <font color="green0">Calling an Overloaded Function</f>

**Overloaded Function Calls:**
- When calling an overloaded function, the process of matching the function call to the correct function is known as *function matching* or *overload resolution*.
- The **compiler** compares the arguments in the function call to the parameters of each overloaded function to determine which one to invoke.

**Key Factors in Function Matching:**
1. **Argument and Parameter Matching:**
   - The compiler checks the number and types of arguments in the function call and compares them with the available overloaded functions.
   - If the functions differ in argument count or the types are unrelated, it's usually straightforward to identify the correct match.

2. **Conversion and Similar Parameter Types:**
   - If multiple overloaded functions have parameters that can be related through conversions, it becomes more complex to determine the correct function. 
   - The compiler handles conversions and attempts to resolve which function is the best match (discussed in more detail in §6.6).

**Possible Outcomes of Overload Resolution:**
1. **Exact Match Found:**
   - The compiler finds a single best match for the provided arguments, and the function is called successfully.
   
2. **No Match:**
   - If no function has parameters that match the arguments, the compiler generates an error indicating that no function could be matched.
   
3. **Ambiguous Call:**
   - If more than one function matches the call and there is no clear best match, the compiler reports an error due to ambiguity in the function call.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Overloading and Scope:</u></f>

**Key Concepts**:
1. **Overloading**: The process of defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists.
2. **Scope**: Refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables and functions within different parts of the program.

### Notes:

1. **Overloading and Scope Interaction**:
   - Overloading doesn’t alter the rules of scope. When a name is declared in an inner scope, it **hides** the declaration from the outer scope. This applies to overloaded functions as well.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     string read();
     void print(const string &);
     void print(double); // overloads the print function
     void fooBar(int ival)
     {
         bool read = false; // new scope: hides outer 'read' declaration
         string s = read(); // error: 'read' is now a bool variable
         void print(int);   // new scope: hides earlier 'print' functions
         print("Value: ");  // error: 'print(const string &)' is hidden
         print(ival);       // ok: 'print(int)' is visible
         print(3.14);       // ok: calls 'print(int)', 'print(double)' is hidden
     }
     ```
   - **Result**: The inner scope declaration of `read` as a `bool` hides the outer scope `read()` function, resulting in an error. Similarly, the declaration of `print(int)` hides the previous overloads of `print` that accept `const string &` and `double`.

2. **Name Hiding and Resolution**:
   - When a function name is declared in an inner scope, it **hides** all previous instances of that name from outer scopes.
   - In the example above:
     - The local `read` variable (a `bool`) hides the global `read()` function.
     - The local `print(int)` hides the overloaded `print(const string&)` and `print(double)` functions from the outer scope.

3. **Name Lookup Process**:
   - In C++, **name lookup** occurs before **type checking**. 
   - When the compiler encounters a call to `print`, it looks for the first declaration in the current scope. If it finds a match, it doesn’t consider any declarations in outer scopes, even if those overloads might provide a better match.
   - **Example**: 
     ```cpp
     void print(const string &);
     void print(double);
     void print(int); // declared in fooBar()
     ```
     - The call `print("Value: ");` fails because only `print(int)` is visible, and a `string` cannot be converted to an `int`.
     - The call `print(3.14);` succeeds because `3.14` (a `double`) can be converted to an `int`, so `print(int)` is used, even though `print(double)` exists in the outer scope.

4. **Correct Overloading**:
   - If `print(int)` is declared in the same scope as the other overloaded functions, the compiler will see all the overloads and resolve function calls appropriately.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     void print(const string &);
     void print(double);
     void print(int);
     void fooBar2(int ival)
     {
         print("Value: "); // calls print(const string &)
         print(ival);      // calls print(int)
         print(3.14);      // calls print(double)
     }
     ```
   - In this case, the compiler has access to all three overloaded versions of `print`, and calls are resolved correctly based on the argument types.

### Summary:
- **Local function declarations hide outer scope functions**, even when overloading is involved.
- **Name lookup occurs before type checking**, so once a name is found in the current scope, the compiler doesn’t consider outer scope declarations.
- To avoid such issues, it's best to **avoid declaring functions in inner scopes** unless necessary. Keeping all overloads in the same scope allows the compiler to resolve calls correctly based on the arguments.
