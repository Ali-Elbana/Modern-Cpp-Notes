## <font color="yellow"><u>Chapter Summary Notes:</u></f>

- **Function Structure**:  
  A function in C++ consists of:
  - **Return type**: Specifies the type of value the function returns.
  - **Name**: Identifies the function.
  - **Parameter list**: A list of variables (parameters) that receive values (arguments) when the function is called.
  - **Function body**: A block of code that executes when the function is invoked.
  
- **Function Call**:  
  When a function is called, the arguments must match the parameters in type or be convertible.

- **Overloading**:  
  C++ allows **function overloading**, where multiple functions can share the same name if their parameters differ in number or type. The compiler uses **function matching** to determine which overloaded function to call based on the arguments passed.

### **Defined Terms**

- **Ambiguous Call**:  
  A compile-time error occurring when multiple functions provide equally valid matches for a function call.

- **Arguments**:  
  Values passed to a function during a call, used to initialize the function’s parameters.

- **Assert**:  
  A preprocessor macro that checks a condition at runtime. If the condition is false, it prints an error message and terminates the program.

- **Automatic Objects**:  
  Objects that are created when control enters the scope and destroyed when the scope ends.

- **Best Match**:  
  The function selected from overloaded candidates that best matches the call arguments.

- **Call by Reference**:  
  Also known as **pass by reference**, it involves passing the reference to an argument rather than a copy.

- **Call by Value**:  
  Also known as **pass by value**, it involves passing a copy of the argument’s value.

- **Candidate Functions**:  
  The set of all functions with the same name as the function being called and visible at the point of the call.

- **Constexpr**:  
  A function that can return a constant expression and is implicitly inline.

- **Default Argument**:  
  A value provided for a function parameter that is used if no argument is passed for that parameter during the call.

- **Executable File**:  
  A file containing machine code that the operating system can execute.

- **Function**:  
  A callable unit of computation consisting of a return type, name, parameters, and a function body.

- **Function Body**:  
  The block of code that defines the behavior of the function.

- **Function Matching**:  
  The process the compiler uses to match a function call to the correct overloaded function by comparing arguments with parameter lists.

- **Function Prototype**:  
  A declaration of a function, specifying its name, return type, and parameters.

- **Hidden Names**:  
  Variables declared in an inner scope that hide variables of the same name declared in an outer scope.

- **Initializer List**:  
  A library class that represents a list of objects of a single type enclosed in curly braces.

- **Inline Function**:  
  A function that suggests to the compiler to expand the function inline at the point of call to avoid function call overhead.

- **Linking**:  
  The step in compilation where multiple object files are combined to create an executable program.

- **Local Static Objects**:  
  Objects within a function that persist across function calls and are only destroyed when the program ends.

- **Local Variables**:  
  Variables declared within a block, existing only within that block.

- **No Match**:  
  A compile-time error that occurs when none of the overloaded functions match the arguments passed in a call.

- **Object Code**:  
  The output of the compiler, which is a translation of the source code into machine code.

- **Object File**:  
  A file that holds the object code, which later combines with other object files during linking to produce an executable.

- **Object Lifetime**:  
  The duration an object exists in memory. For example, non-static objects inside blocks exist from their definition until the end of the block.

- **Overload Resolution**:  
  Another term for **function matching**.

- **Overloaded Function**:  
  A function with the same name as another function but differing in parameters (either number or type).

- **Parameters**:  
  Variables defined in the function declaration that receive values when the function is called.

- **Pass by Reference**:  
  Parameters that receive references to the argument rather than a copy, allowing modification of the original argument.

- **Pass by Value**:  
  Parameters that receive a copy of the argument's value, ensuring the original argument is unaffected by modifications.

- **Preprocessor Macro**:  
  A feature that defines inline-like behavior at compile time, mainly used for simple substitutions or conditions like `assert`.

- **Recursion Loop**:  
  A recursive function without a termination condition, leading to infinite recursive calls and eventually stack exhaustion.

- **Recursive Function**:  
  A function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly.

- **Return Type**:  
  Specifies the type of the value a function returns.

- **Separate Compilation**:  
  The ability to divide a program across multiple source files, which are compiled independently and then linked together.

- **Trailing Return Type**:  
  Specifies the return type of a function after the parameter list.

- **Viable Functions**:  
  Candidate functions that have the same number of parameters as the arguments passed and can convert each argument type to the corresponding parameter type.

- **() Operator**:  
  Also called the **call operator**, used to execute a function. It appears after the function’s name or pointer and encloses the argument list.
