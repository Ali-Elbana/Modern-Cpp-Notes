### C++ Classes: Data Abstraction and Encapsulation

- **Classes as Custom Data Types**:  
  In C++, we use classes to define custom data types. This allows us to represent concepts from the problem domain directly in our code, making it easier to write, debug, and modify programs.

- **Data Abstraction**:  
  Data abstraction is a design technique that separates **interface** from **implementation**:
  - **Interface**: The set of operations that users of the class can perform.
  - **Implementation**: Consists of:
    - The data members of the class.
    - The function bodies of the operations that define the interface.
    - Additional functions necessary for the class but not intended for general use.

- **Encapsulation**:  
  Encapsulation enforces the division between a class’s interface and implementation. By hiding the implementation details, encapsulation ensures that:
  - Users can interact with the interface.
  - Users have no access to the internal implementation of the class.

- **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**:  
  When a class employs data abstraction and encapsulation, it forms an **abstract data type**:
  - **Class Designer’s Role**: Handles the implementation details.
  - **Programmer’s Role**: Uses the class based on what it does, not on how it works internally.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Introducing this:</u></f>

1. **Calling a Member Function**:
   - Example: `total.isbn()`
   - The **dot operator** (`.`) accesses the `isbn` member function of the `total` object.

2. **Implicit Object Reference in Member Functions**:
   - When a member function is called, it acts on behalf of an **object**.
   - In `isbn`, when accessing class members (e.g., `bookNo`), these references are **implicitly** directed to members of the object that invoked the function.
   - In the example, `isbn` returns `bookNo` as `total.bookNo` implicitly.

3. **The `this` Pointer**:
   - Member functions access their calling object through an implicit parameter called **`this`**.
   - **Initialization of `this`**:
     - Upon function invocation (e.g., `total.isbn()`), the compiler initializes `this` with the **address of the calling object** (`total` in this case).
     - Conceptually, the compiler translates `total.isbn()` as:
       ```cpp
       Sales_data::isbn(&total);
       ```
   
4. **Implicit Member Access via `this`**:
   - Within a member function, class members can be accessed **directly** without the dot operator (`.`).
   - These direct accesses are implicitly done through `this`.
   - Example: `isbn` accesses `bookNo` as `this->bookNo`.

5. **Restrictions on `this`**:
   - `this` is an implicit, reserved parameter and cannot be redefined as another parameter or variable.
   - In the member function body, you can use `this` explicitly, but it is **unnecessary** for typical access.
   - Example of using `this` explicitly (though redundant):
     ```cpp
     std::string isbn() const { return this->bookNo; }
     ```

6. **Characteristics of `this`**:
   - `this` is a **const pointer**: its address cannot be changed.
   - Always points to the current object instance within the function.

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>Introducing const Member Functions:</u></f>

**1. Purpose of `const` in Member Functions:**
   - The keyword `const` following the parameter list in a member function indicates that the function will not modify the object it’s called on.
   - This `const` modifies the implicit `this` pointer, making it a pointer to a `const` version of the class.

**2. Default Type of `this`:**
   - By default, `this` is a constant pointer to a non-const object.
   - For example, in a `Sales_data` member function, `this` is of type `Sales_data *const`.
   - Because of this default, `this` cannot bind to a `const` object, so ordinary (non-const) member functions cannot be called on `const` objects.

**3. Making `this` a Pointer to `const`:**
   - If `isbn` were a regular function, `this` would be declared as `const Sales_data *const` to prevent modifications to the object.
   - Since `this` is implicit and does not appear in the parameter list, we use `const` after the parameter list to make `this` a pointer to `const`.

**4. How `const` Modifies `this` in Const Member Functions:**
   - Adding `const` after the parameter list tells the compiler that `this` is `const`, allowing the function to be called on `const` objects.
   - For example, a `const` member function can be thought of in pseudo-code as:
     ```cpp
     std::string Sales_data::isbn(const Sales_data *const this)
     { return this->isbn; }
     ```
   - This pseudo-code is illegal in C++, as `this` is implicitly handled by the language.

**5. Restrictions on `const` Member Functions:**
   - `const` member functions can read, but cannot modify, data members of the object they are called on.
   - Objects that are `const`, or references/pointers to `const` objects, may only call `const` member functions.

**6. Summary Note:**
   - Using `const` after the parameter list enhances function flexibility, allowing `const` objects to safely access member functions without modifying object data.

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>Class Scope and Member Functions:</u></f>

1. **Class as a Scope**:
   - In C++, a class defines its own scope.
   - Members (both functions and data members) are enclosed within the class scope.

2. **Member Functions and Data Member Resolution**:
   - The member functions of a class are defined within the scope of the class.
   - This setup allows member functions to access and use data members directly, as if they are within the same scope.
   - Example: If `isbn` is a member function and `bookNo` is a data member, `isbn` can use `bookNo` directly within its scope.

3. **Order of Member Declarations and Usage**:
   - A member function can reference other members, even if those members are defined after the function within the class.
   - This is possible because the compiler processes classes in two phases:
     1. **First Phase**: The compiler reads and compiles member declarations (e.g., function signatures and data member types).
     2. **Second Phase**: It then compiles the bodies of member functions.
   - This phased approach enables member function bodies to access any class members without depending on the order in which they are declared.

4. **Implications for Member Function Definitions**:
   - Since member functions can use other class members regardless of declaration order, the code within these functions can be more flexible.
   - This approach supports the intuitive use of all class members within function definitions and promotes organized code structure.

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>Defining a Member Function outside the Class:</u></f>

1. **Definition Outside the Class**  
   - When defining a member function outside the class body, its definition must match its declaration inside the class:
     - This includes the **return type**, **parameter list**, and **function name**.
     - If the function is a **const member function** in the class declaration, the definition must also specify `const` after the parameter list.

2. **Using the Scope Operator (::)**  
   - The function name should include the name of the class to indicate it’s a member:
     - Example: `double Sales_data::avg_price() const { /* function body */ }`
   - Here, `Sales_data::avg_price` specifies that `avg_price` is a function defined within the scope of the `Sales_data` class.
   - This use of the **scope operator (`::`)** directs the compiler to recognize `avg_price` as part of `Sales_data`.

3. **Scope Implications in the Definition**  
   - Once the compiler recognizes the function name with the class scope, it interprets all further code within the function body as being in the **scope of the class**.
   - This means member variables like `revenue` and `units_sold` can be accessed directly within `avg_price` without additional qualification.

4. **Example Code**  
   ```cpp
   double Sales_data::avg_price() const {
       if (units_sold)
           return revenue / units_sold;
       else
           return 0;
   }
   ```

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>Defining a Function to Return “This” Object:</u></f>

**Purpose of the `combine` Function**  
- The `combine` function is designed to resemble the compound assignment operator (`+=`).
- In this context, the object calling `combine` serves as the left-hand operand, while the right-hand operand is passed as an argument.

**Function Definition**  
```cpp
Sales_data& Sales_data::combine(const Sales_data &rhs)
{
    units_sold += rhs.units_sold; // add rhs's members to this object
    revenue += rhs.revenue;
    return *this; // return the object on which the function was called
}
```

**Explanation**  
1. **Function Call**  
   - When `total.combine(trans);` is called, `total` binds to the implicit `this` pointer, and `rhs` binds to `trans`.
   - The `combine` function then adds the values of `trans` to `total`'s respective members, updating `total`.

2. **Return Type and Statement**  
   - To mimic built-in operators (like `+=`), the function returns its left-hand operand as an *lvalue*.
   - The return type `Sales_data&` returns a reference to the calling object.
   - The `return *this;` statement dereferences `this` to return the entire object on which the function was called.

**Key Points**  
- **Using `this` Pointer**:  
  - No need to use `this` to access members directly, but it’s necessary to dereference `this` when returning the object itself.

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>Defining Nonmember Class-Related Functions:</u></f>

- **Purpose of Nonmember Functions**:  
  - Nonmember functions are often used to define auxiliary operations (like `add`, `read`, and `print`).
  - These functions serve as part of the class’s interface but are not implemented within the class.

- **Definition and Declaration**:  
  - Define nonmember functions as you would any other function.
  - Generally, separate the declaration and definition of these functions:
    - **Declaration** is typically in the class’s header file.
    - **Definition** is often in a separate implementation file.

- **Including Headers**:  
  - To make it easy for users, declare nonmember functions in the same header file as the class.
  - This inclusion ensures that only one file needs to be included to use all parts of the class interface.

- **Best Practice**:  
  - Nonmember functions intended to be part of a class interface should always be declared in the same header as the class itself.

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>Constructors:</u></f>

1. **Definition and Purpose**
   - Constructors are special member functions in a class, designed to control object initialization.
   - Each class defines how its objects are initialized by specifying one or more constructors.
   - The primary job of a constructor is to initialize the data members of the class object.

2. **Invocation**
   - A constructor is automatically run each time an object of the class type is created.

3. **Complexity**
   - Constructors are a broad topic in C++ and will be explored further in specific sections (§ 7.5, § 15.7, § 18.1.3) and Chapter 13 of "C++ Primer".

4. **Naming and Syntax**
   - Constructors must have the same name as the class.
   - They do not have a return type, unlike other member functions.
   - Constructors can take a parameter list, which may be empty, and can have a body, which may also be empty.

5. **Overloading**
   - A class can have multiple constructors, known as overloaded constructors.
   - Like any overloaded function, constructors in the same class must differ in the number or types of their parameters to ensure unique signatures.

6. **Restrictions on `const`**
   - Constructors cannot be declared as `const`.
   - When creating a `const` object, the object does not assume constness until after the constructor has completed the initialization.
   - Therefore, constructors can modify `const` objects during construction.

### <font color="green0">Synthesized Default Constructor </font>

**Definition:**
- The *default constructor* is a special constructor that takes no arguments and is used to perform default initialization on objects.
- When a class does not explicitly define any constructors, the compiler automatically provides a default constructor called the *synthesized default constructor*.

**Example from Sales_data Class:**
- The `Sales_data` class does not explicitly define any constructors.
- In the example on page 255, two objects, `total` and `trans`, were created as follows:
  ```cpp
  Sales_data total; // Variable to hold the running sum
  Sales_data trans; // Variable to hold data for the next transaction
  ```
- Since no initializer was provided for these objects, they undergo *default initialization*.

**Behavior of Synthesized Default Constructor:**
- For classes without user-defined constructors, the compiler-generated default constructor initializes data members based on specific rules:
  - **If a member has an in-class initializer** (such as a direct assignment in its declaration), that initializer is used.
  - **If a member lacks an in-class initializer**, it undergoes default initialization, which can vary based on the member type.

**Application in Sales_data:**
- `Sales_data` includes initializers for `units_sold` and `revenue`, so the synthesized default constructor uses those values to initialize these members.
- Since no initializer is provided for `bookNo`, it is default-initialized to an empty string.

This synthesized behavior ensures that objects of `Sales_data` can be created and used even when no explicit constructor is defined.

### <font color="green0">Some Classes Cannot Rely on the Synthesized Default Constructor</font>

#### Reasons:

1. **Synthesized Default Constructor Availability**
   - The compiler generates a synthesized default constructor only if the class has **no other constructors** defined.
   - If a class has any explicitly defined constructors, the compiler will **not generate a default constructor automatically**.
   - Rationale: If a class needs custom initialization for some constructors, it is likely to need it for all, which is why the default constructor isn't provided by the compiler in such cases.

2. **Cases Where the Synthesized Default Constructor Might Do the Wrong Thing**
   - For classes with **members of built-in or compound types** (such as arrays or pointers), the synthesized default constructor may result in **undefined values**.
   - Built-in and compound types inside a block are default-initialized to an **undefined value** if they aren’t explicitly initialized.
   - To avoid objects with undefined values:
     - Either **initialize these members directly in the class**.
     - Or, **define a custom default constructor** to ensure proper initialization.

3. **Members with In-Class Initializers**
   - If all built-in or compound type members have **in-class initializers**, the class can often rely on the synthesized default constructor.
   - In-class initializers provide a way to set default values for members, thus reducing the risk of undefined values.

4. **Inability of Compiler to Synthesize a Default Constructor**
   - The compiler cannot synthesize a default constructor if a class has a **member that itself lacks a default constructor**.
   - In such cases, the class must define its **own default constructor** to handle initialization.
   - Example: If a member variable is an object of a type without a default constructor, the containing class must provide its own default constructor.
   
5. **Additional Complex Cases**
   - There are other scenarios, explored in more advanced sections (e.g., §13.1.6), where the compiler cannot generate a suitable default constructor, necessitating a custom-defined default constructor.

These considerations highlight that for many classes, especially those with members that need specific initialization or involve complex types, a custom default constructor is necessary to ensure well-defined object state and avoid unexpected behavior.

### <font color="green0">What = default Means</font>

- **Purpose of `= default`:** 
  - The `= default` keyword instructs the compiler to generate a default implementation of a function, typically used for constructors and destructors.
  
- **Default Constructor Example:**
  - Example of using `= default` for a default constructor:
    ```cpp
    Sales_data() = default;
    ```
  - In this case, `Sales_data()` defines a default constructor with no arguments. The `= default` syntax tells the compiler to use the synthesized, or auto-generated, constructor.
  
- **Why Use `= default`:** 
  - `= default` is helpful when we want to create custom constructors but still need the compiler to generate the default constructor for us.
  - It ensures that the default constructor performs the same initialization as the synthesized version.

- **Placement of `= default`:** 
  - You can place `= default` either:
    - **Inside the class definition:** The default constructor will be inlined.
    - **Outside the class definition:** The constructor will not be inlined by default.

- **Summary:** 
  - Using `= default` allows us to retain the synthesized behavior of functions (like the default constructor) while customizing other parts of a class’s functionality. This feature is part of C++’s enhanced constructor controls in newer standards, making defaulted behavior explicit and predictable.

### <font color="green0">Constructor Initializer List</font>

- **Constructor Initializer List**: A mechanism in C++ constructors for initializing data members before the constructor body runs.  
  - Syntax: After the constructor parameter list, a colon (`:`) precedes the list of initializations.
  - Structure: Each data member is followed by its initial value in parentheses or curly braces, separated by commas for multiple members.

- **Example Syntax**:
  ```cpp
  Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s) { }
  Sales_data(const std::string &s, unsigned n, double p):
      bookNo(s), units_sold(n), revenue(p * n) { }
  ```

- **Purpose**: Used to provide initial values to data members of a class object upon its creation.

#### Detailed Breakdown
- **Single Parameter Constructor**:
  - Uses a string parameter to initialize `bookNo`.
  - `units_sold` and `revenue` are not explicitly initialized in the initializer list and are thus default-initialized (using in-class initializers, if available).
  
- **Multi-Parameter Constructor**:
  - Uses parameters to initialize multiple data members:
    - `bookNo` is initialized with a string parameter.
    - `units_sold` is initialized with an unsigned integer.
    - `revenue` is computed by multiplying the number of units sold (`n`) by the price per unit (`p`).

- **Implicit Initialization**:
  - If a data member is missing in the initializer list, it is initialized via in-class initializers or default initialization.
  - For example:
    ```cpp
    Sales_data(const std::string &s):
        bookNo(s), units_sold(0), revenue(0) { }
    ```

#### Best Practices for Initializers
- **Prefer In-Class Initializers**: If an in-class initializer correctly sets the data member's value, use it in constructors.
- **Explicit Initialization for Built-in Types**: If the compiler lacks support for in-class initializers, ensure that all constructors explicitly initialize each built-in type member to prevent undefined behavior.
- **Empty Function Body**: Constructors focusing solely on member initialization can have an empty function body, as the initialization list completes the necessary work.

### <font color="green0">Defining a Constructor outside the Class Body</font>

- **Purpose of the Constructor**  
  The constructor here takes an `istream` as a parameter to initialize the `Sales_data` object. It performs initialization work by calling the `read` function to populate the data members.

- **Syntax and Definition**  
  ```cpp
  Sales_data::Sales_data(std::istream &is) {
      read(is, *this); // reads data from `is` and assigns to `this` object
  }
  ```
  - This constructor does not have a return type, following the rules of C++ constructors.
  - The definition uses the format `ClassName::ConstructorName` outside the class body, indicating that it is a member of `Sales_data`.

- **Empty Constructor Initializer List**  
  - This constructor lacks an initializer list, meaning the list is technically empty. However, the class members are still initialized:
    - **With In-Class Initializers**: If specified, the member variables are initialized by their in-class initializers.
    - **Default Initialization**: Otherwise, members default to basic initialization rules. For `Sales_data`, this results in:
      - `bookNo` initialized as an empty string
      - `units_sold` and `revenue` set to `0`

- **Role of `*this` and `read`**  
  - The `read` function takes a reference to a `Sales_data` object as its second argument.
  - Here, `*this` (the dereferenced pointer to the current object) is used to pass the object itself to `read`.
  - Using `this` in this way accesses the entire object, enabling `read` to work with the object as a whole rather than individual members.

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>Copy, Assignment, and Destruction:</u></f>

#### Overview
- **Class Operations**: Classes control how objects are copied, assigned, or destroyed, in addition to how they are initialized.
  - **Copying**: Occurs in contexts such as initialization, passing, or returning objects by value.
  - **Assignment**: Happens when using the assignment operator.
  - **Destruction**: Occurs when objects cease to exist, e.g., when a local object is destroyed on block exit or when vectors/arrays are destroyed.

#### Default Behavior
- **Compiler-Synthesized Operations**: 
  - If not explicitly defined, the compiler generates default versions for copy, assignment, and destruction.
  - These default operations typically copy, assign, or destroy each member of the class object.
  - Example: In a bookstore program, the default assignment would execute as:
    ```cpp
    total.bookNo = trans.bookNo;
    total.units_sold = trans.units_sold;
    total.revenue = trans.revenue;
    ```

#### Classes that Cannot Rely on Synthesized Versions
- **Special Cases**: 
  - Default versions may not work correctly for classes that allocate external resources, such as dynamic memory.
  - For example, managing dynamic memory requires careful handling, and default synthesized operations may not suffice.
  
#### Classes with Dynamic Memory Management
- **Dynamic Memory**:
  - Classes that manage dynamic memory (like those using `new` or `delete`) generally cannot rely on default synthesized operations. These operations may not properly handle memory allocation/deallocation.
  - We'll explore this in Chapter 12, where dynamic memory management in C++ is covered.
  
#### Safe Approach: Use Containers
- **Vectors and Strings**: 
  - For dynamic memory management, it is recommended to use `std::vector` or `std::string`:
    - These containers handle memory automatically, avoiding manual memory management.
    - The synthesized operations for copy, assignment, and destruction work correctly for classes with vector or string members.
    - When an object with a vector or string member is copied or assigned, the container class takes care of copying or assigning elements.
    - When the object is destroyed, the vector or string destructors handle memory cleanup.

#### Recommendation
- Until custom operations are defined (as explained in Chapter 13), resources in your classes should be stored directly as data members (preferably in containers like vectors or strings) to avoid manual memory management complexities.
