## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

1. **Definition of Interface vs. Encapsulation**
   - A class interface is what we define to interact with the class, including its public methods and constructors.
   - Encapsulation ensures that users must interact with the class through its interface and not access or modify its internal implementation directly.

2. **Access Specifiers in C++**
   - Access specifiers control access to different parts of a class:
     - **public:** Members declared after `public` are accessible by all parts of the program and form the class interface.
     - **private:** Members declared after `private` are only accessible by the class’s member functions. This is where implementation details are hidden from external code.

3. **Example: Redefining `Sales_data` Class with Access Specifiers**
```cpp
   
   class Sales_data {
   public: 
       Sales_data() = default;
       Sales_data(const std::string &s, unsigned n, double p) : 
           bookNo(s), units_sold(n), revenue(p*n) { }
       Sales_data(const std::string &s) : bookNo(s) { }
       Sales_data(std::istream&);
       std::string isbn() const { return bookNo; }
       Sales_data &combine(const Sales_data&);
   private: 
       double avg_price() const { return units_sold ? revenue/units_sold : 0; }
       std::string bookNo;
       unsigned units_sold = 0;
       double revenue = 0.0;
   };
   
   - `isbn` and `combine` are public member functions, part of the interface.
   - `bookNo`, `units_sold`, `revenue`, and `avg_price` are private members,                  encapsulating the class implementation.

```

4. **Rules for Using Access Specifiers**
   - A class can have multiple access specifiers, repeated if necessary.
   - Each specifier remains in effect until another specifier appears or until the end of the class.

### <font color="green0">Using the class or struct Keyword</f>

1. **Class Definition Keywords**:
   - C++ allows defining a class type using either the `class` or `struct` keyword.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```cpp
     class ClassName { /* members */ };
     struct StructName { /* members */ };
     ```

2. **Primary Difference**:
   - **Access Level**:
     - **`struct`**: The default access level for members is **public**.
     - **`class`**: The default access level for members is **private**.

3. **Members Defined Before Access Specifier**:
   - Members defined before the first access specifier will inherit the default access level based on the keyword used.
     - If defined with `struct`, they are **public**.
     - If defined with `class`, they are **private**.

4. **Programming Style**:
   - Use `struct` when the class is intended to have **all public members**.
   - Use `class` if there are **private members** or restricted access control in the class.

5. **Important Note**:
   - The **only technical difference** between `class` and `struct` in C++ is the **default access level** of the members.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Friends:</u></f>

**Friends in C++ Classes**
- **Private Members Access**: When data members are private, non-member functions (e.g., `read`, `print`, and `add` functions) cannot access these members directly. To resolve this, these functions can be made friends of the class.
- **Friend Declaration Syntax**: A class allows a function to access its nonpublic members by declaring it a friend. This is done using the `friend` keyword within the class.
    ```cpp
    class Sales_data {
        // friend declarations for nonmember Sales_data operations
        friend Sales_data add(const Sales_data&, const Sales_data&);
        friend std::istream &read(std::istream&, Sales_data&);
        friend std::ostream &print(std::ostream&, const Sales_data&);
        // other members and access specifiers as before
    };
    ```
- **Placement of Friend Declarations**: Friend declarations must be inside the class definition. However, they are not affected by access control (public/private/protected) and can appear in any section.
- **Tip**: It’s often helpful to group friend declarations at the beginning or end of a class definition for clarity.

**Key Concept: Benefits of Encapsulation**
1. **Protection Against State Corruption**: Encapsulation ensures that user code cannot accidentally alter the internal state of an object. 
2. **Ease of Modification**: With private data members, the class implementation can change over time without affecting the user’s code, provided the interface remains the same.
   - **Example**: If the data structure of the class changes, only internal class code needs to be checked and updated as necessary.
   - **Contrast with Public Data**: If data members are public, any code relying on the old structure would need to be rewritten to accommodate changes.
3. **Simplified Maintenance and Debugging**: When data members are private:
   - Any bugs affecting the object’s state are likely within the class implementation, reducing the areas to inspect for errors.
4. **Impact on Compilation**: Even though user code doesn’t need to change with class modifications, any source files using the class must be recompiled whenever the class definition changes.

**Nonmember Functions in Sales_data Interface**
```cpp
// These nonmember functions are friends of Sales_data
Sales_data add(const Sales_data&, const Sales_data&);
std::istream &read(std::istream&, Sales_data&);
std::ostream &print(std::ostream&, const Sales_data&);
```

### <font color="green0">Declarations for Friends</f>

1. **Friend Declarations Grant Access Only**  
   - A `friend` declaration in a class gives a function or another class access to its private members.
   - It **does not serve as a general declaration** of the function.

2. **Separate Declaration for Usability**  
   - To enable **class users to call a friend function**, the function must also have a separate declaration outside the class.
   - Typically, each `friend` function is declared outside the class body in the **same header file** as the class itself.
   - For example, the `Sales_data` class header might include separate declarations for `read`, `print`, and `add` functions, aside from any `friend` declarations inside the class body.

3. **Compiler Behavior and Friend Function Rules**  
   - Many compilers do **not strictly enforce** that friend functions must be declared outside the class.
   - Some compilers permit calls to a friend function even if it lacks an ordinary external declaration.

4. **Best Practice: Provide Separate Declarations**  
   - Regardless of whether the compiler requires it, it’s considered good practice to **declare friend functions separately** outside the class.
   - Doing so ensures portability, preventing issues if a compiler enforces the rule in the future.
