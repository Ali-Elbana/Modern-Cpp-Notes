**Function:**

- The `sizeof` operator retrieves the size, in **bytes**, of an **expression** or a **type name**.
- It plays a crucial role in memory management and understanding data layout.

**Key Points:**

- **Right Associative:** Groups expressions from right to left.
- **Constant Expression:** Returns a fixed value known at compile time.
- **Operand Non-Evaluation:** Doesn't actually evaluate the expression it operates on.

**Usage:**

- `sizeof(type)`: Gets the size of a specific type.
- `sizeof expr`: Gets the size of the **type** returned by the expression.

**Examples:**

- `sizeof(Sales_data);` // Size of a `Sales_data` object.
- `sizeof data;` // Same as `sizeof(Sales_data)`.
- `sizeof p;` // Size of a pointer variable.
- `sizeof *p;` // Size of the type pointed to by `p` (safe even for uninitialized pointers).
- `sizeof data.revenue;` // Size of the `revenue` member within `Sales_data`.
- `sizeof Sales_data::revenue;` // Alternative way to get the size of `revenue`.

**`sizeof *p` Explanation:**

- Right associativity: `sizeof *p` is equivalent to `sizeof(*p)`.
- Non-evaluation: `sizeof` doesn't dereference `p`, so it's safe for invalid pointers.

**New Standard Feature:**

- The scope resolution operator (`::`) allows querying member size within a class.
- `sizeof Sales_data::revenue` gets the size of the `revenue` member.

**Results Based on Type:**

- `char`: Guaranteed to be 1 byte.
- Reference types: Size of the referenced object.
- Pointers: Size needed to hold a pointer.
- Dereferenced pointers: Size of the pointed-to object.
- Arrays: Size of the entire array (element size x number of elements).
- Strings and vectors: Size of the fixed part, not including dynamic elements.

**Determining Array Size:**

- Divide the array size by element size: `sizeof(ia) / sizeof(*ia)`.

**Constant Expression Benefit:**

- The constant size returned by `sizeof` allows declaring arrays with dynamic sizes based on the result:
    
    ```cpp
    constexpr size_t sz = sizeof(ia) / sizeof(*ia);
    int arr2[sz];  // Valid because sizeof returns a constant expression
    ```
    

**Summary:**

- `sizeof` is a versatile tool for memory management and understanding data layout in C++.
- Its right associativity, non-evaluation behavior, and ability to handle different types make it a powerful operator.
