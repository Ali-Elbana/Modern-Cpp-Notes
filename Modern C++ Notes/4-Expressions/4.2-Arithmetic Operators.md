This note provides an overview of arithmetic operators in C++ along with key considerations for their use.

**Table 4.1: Arithmetic Operators**

|Operator|Function|Use|
|---|---|---|
|`+` (unary)|Unary plus|Copies and potentially promotes operand's value|
|`-` (unary)|Unary minus|Negates a copy of operand's value (possibly promoted)|
|`*`|Multiplication|Multiplies two operands|
|`/`|Division|Divides two operands (integer division truncates remainders)|
|`%`|Modulus|Computes the remainder of integer division|
|`+` (binary)|Addition|Adds two operands|
|`-` (binary)|Subtraction|Subtracts operands|

**Precedence and Associativity:**

- Operators are grouped by precedence.
- Unary operators have higher precedence than multiplication/division.
- Multiplication/division have higher precedence than addition/subtraction.
- Operators of the same precedence group from left to right (left-associative).

**Operand Types and Results:**

- Applicable to arithmetic types or types convertible to them.
- Operands and results are rvalues (values).
- Promotion might occur for small integral types (e.g., `char` to `int`).
- Common type might be determined during evaluation.

**Unary Plus and Pointers:**

- Unary plus with pointers returns a (possibly promoted) copy of the pointer value.

**Unary Minus:**

- Negates a copy of the operand's value.

**Boolean Operand Behavior (Caution):**

- Applying arithmetic operators to booleans is generally discouraged.
- `bool` to `int` promotion can lead to unexpected results due to integer truncation.

**Overflow and Other Exceptions:**

- Certain arithmetic expressions can have undefined results.
- Division by zero is mathematically undefined.
- Overflow occurs when a result exceeds the representable range of the type (e.g., integer overflow).
- Overflow behavior is unpredictable and can vary across systems.

**Integer Division and Remainder:**

- Division of integers results in an integer (truncated towards zero).
- Remainder (`%`) operator calculates the remainder after integer division.

**Modulus Operator:**

- Operands must be of integral type.
- `(m / n) * n + m % n` equals `m` for integers `m` and non-zero `n`.
- The sign of `m % n` is the same as the sign of `m`.
