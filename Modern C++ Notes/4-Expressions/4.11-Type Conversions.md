## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

**Type Compatibility and Conversions:**

- In C++, types can be related, allowing conversion between them when needed.
- When an expression involves operands of different types, the compiler might perform implicit conversions to ensure compatibility.

**Example: Integer Addition with a Double**

```cpp
int ival = 3.541 + 3;  // Compiler might warn about precision loss
```

- Here, `3.541` is a double, and `3` is an int.
- To perform addition, the compiler implicitly converts `3` to a double (preserving precision).
- The result is a double (6.541).
- During initialization (`ival = ...`), the double value is converted (truncated) to an int (6) and assigned to `ival`.

**Implicit Conversions: Automatic and Potentially Unseen**

- These conversions happen automatically without programmer intervention.
- This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not fully understood.

**Priorities for Implicit Conversions:**

- Conversions aim to preserve precision whenever possible.
- When mixing integral and floating-point types, integrals are typically promoted to floats.
##### <font color="red">Scenarios for Implicit Conversions:</font>

- **Promotion of Small Integers:** Smaller integral types are converted to larger ones (e.g., char to int).
- **Conditions:** Non-boolean expressions in conditions are converted to bool (true or false).
- **Initializations and Assignments:** The initializer/right-hand operand is converted to the type of the variable/left-hand operand.
- **Arithmetic and Relational Expressions:** Mixed types are converted to a common type for calculations and comparisons.
- **Function Calls:** Argument types might be converted to match function parameter types.

**Remember:** Implicit conversions can be helpful, but be aware of potential precision loss or unexpected behavior. Understanding their rules is crucial for writing predictable C++ code.

## <font color="yellow"><u>The Arithmetic Conversions:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Recap of Arithmetic Conversions:**

- Arithmetic conversions are implicit type transformations that occur within expressions involving multiple arithmetic types.
- These conversions ensure consistent operand types for arithmetic operations.

**Conversion Hierarchy:**

- C++ defines a hierarchy of arithmetic types, with <font color="red">wider types</font> taking precedence.
- During an arithmetic operation, if operands have different types, the narrower operand is converted to a type higher in the hierarchy.

**Example:**

- If you have `long double` and `int` operands, the `int` is converted to `long double` before the operation is performed.

**General Rule: Mixing Floating-Point and Integral Values:**

- When expressions involve both floating-point and integral types, <font color="red">the integral value is promoted to a suitable floating-point type</font>.
- This ensures consistent floating-point arithmetic.

**Benefits of Arithmetic Conversions:**

- Allow seamless usage of different arithmetic types within expressions.
- Prevent potential errors caused by mixing incompatible types.

## <font color="green0">Integral Promotions</f>

**Automatic Type Adjustments:**

C++ performs automatic type conversions called "integral promotions" when dealing with smaller integral types. These conversions ensure compatibility between different integer types in expressions.

**Types Affected:**

- `bool`
- `char`
- `signed char`
- `unsigned char`
- `short`
- `unsigned short`
##### <font color="red">Promotion Rules:</font>

1. **Promotion to `int`:**
    - If all possible values of the smaller type can be represented without loss of information by an `int`, the value is promoted to `int`.
    - This is the most common scenario for the above-mentioned types, as `int` is typically a wider integer type.
2. **Promotion to `unsigned int`:**
    - If the smaller type's range cannot be fully accommodated by an `int`, the value is promoted to `unsigned int`.
    - This ensures that the full range of the smaller type's values is preserved, even if negative values are lost.

**Special Case: `bool`:**

- A `bool` value is promoted to:
    - `0` if it's false.
    - `1` if it's true.

**Larger Character Types:**

- Wider character types (`wchar_t`, `char16_t`, and `char32_t`) have a more complex promotion rule.
- They are promoted to <font color="red">the smallest of the following types that can hold all their possible values</font>:
    - `int`
    - `unsigned int`
    - `long`
    - `unsigned long`
    - `long long`
    - `unsigned long long`

**Why Promotions Matter:**

- Integral promotions play a crucial role in C++ expressions.
- They ensure that different integer types can be used together without explicit casting, simplifying code and avoiding potential data loss issues.

## <font color="green0">Operands of Unsigned Type</f>

#### Mixing Signed and Unsigned Operands in C++

**Understanding Operand Promotion with Mixed Signedness:**

- When operators involve operands of different types, C++ performs conversions to a common type for the operation.
- If any operand is unsigned, the conversion rules depend on the relative sizes of integer types on your specific system.

**Conversion Steps:**

1. **Integral Promotions:**
    - Standard integer promotions (e.g., `char` to `int`) happen first.
    
2. **Same Signedness:**
    - If both operands have the same signedness (both signed or both unsigned) after promotions, the smaller type is converted to the larger type.
    
3. **Differing Signedness (Unsigned First):**
    - If the signedness differs and the <font color="red">unsigned operand's type is larger than or equal to the signed operand's type</font> (after promotions), <font color="red">the signed operand is converted to unsigned</font>.
        - Example: `unsigned int` and `int` - the `int` becomes `unsigned int`.
        - Important Note: If the `int` has a negative value, the conversion follows specific rules (Wrap around) to handle the sign bit.
        
4. **Differing Signedness (Signed First):**
    - This is the most complex case. <font color="red">If the signed operand has a larger type than the unsigned operand</font> (after promotions), the behavior is <font color="red">machine-dependent</font>:
        - If all values of the <font color="red">unsigned type can fit</font> within the larger signed type, <font color="red">the unsigned operand is converted to signed</font>.
        - Conversely, if the <font color="red">unsigned type has the same size or more bits than the signed type</font>, <font color="red">the signed operand is converted to unsigned</font>.
            - Example: `long` and `unsigned int` (assuming `int` and `long` have the same size), the `long` becomes `unsigned int`.
            - If `long` has more bits, the `unsigned int` becomes `long`.

**Summary:**

- Understanding these conversion rules for mixed signedness is crucial for predictable behavior in C++ expressions.
- When possible, it's recommended to use operands with the same signedness for clarity and to avoid potential machine-dependent behavior.

## <font color="green0">Understanding the Arithmetic Conversions</f>

**Understanding Implicit Conversions:**

- Let's explore some examples to grasp the underlying rules.

```cpp
bool  flag;  char cval;
short sval;  unsigned short usval;
int   ival;  unsigned int uival;
long  lval;  unsigned long ulval;
float fval;  double dval;
```

**Examples:**

- **`3.14159L + 'a'`:**
    
    - `'a'` is promoted to `int` (its numeric value, which is machine-dependent, let's say 97).
    - The `int` is then converted to `long double` (matching the wider type of the literal).
    - Finally, the addition is performed using these converted values.
    
- **`dval + ival`:**
    
    - `ival` is converted to `double` (matching the wider floating-point type).
    
- **`dval + fval`:**
    
    - `fval` is converted to `double` (both operands are already floating-point).
    
- **`ival = dval`:**
    
    - `dval` is converted to `int` (truncating any decimal part).
    
- **`flag = dval`:**
    
    - `dval` is converted to `bool` (0 becomes `false`, non-zero becomes `true`).
    
- **`cval + fval`:**
    
    - `cval` is promoted to `int` before conversion to `float` (matching the wider type).
    
- **`sval + cval`:**
    
    - Both `sval` and `cval` are promoted to `int` before the addition.
    
- **`cval + lval`:**
    
    - `cval` is converted to `long` (matching the wider integral type).
    
- **`ival + ulval`:**
    
    - `ival` is converted to `unsigned long` (depending on the sizes of `int` and `unsigned long` on your system).
    
- **`usval + ival`:**
    
    - The conversion here depends on the relative sizes of `unsigned short` and `int`. The operand with the smaller size is converted to the larger type.
    
- **`uival + lval`:**
    
    - Similar to the previous case, the conversion depends on the sizes of `unsigned int` and `long`.

**Understanding Character Promotion:**

- Character constants (`'a'`, etc.) have a numeric value (machine-dependent) that gets promoted to `int` when used in arithmetic expressions.

**Machine-Dependent Conversions:**

- The last two examples (`ival + ulval` and `uival + lval`) involve conversions that depend on the specific sizes of integer types on your system.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Other Implicit Convertions:</u></f>

**Beyond Arithmetic Conversions:**

C++ offers various implicit conversions beyond those for arithmetic operations. Here's a breakdown of some key types:

**1. Array to Pointer Conversion:**

- In most expressions, arrays are automatically converted to pointers to their first element.
- Example: `int ia[10]; int* ip = ia; // ip points to ia[0]`
- Exceptions:
    - `decltype` operator
    - `&` (address-of), `sizeof`, `typeid` operators
    - Reference initialization (`int& ref = ia;`)

**2. Pointer Conversions:**

- Several pointer conversions exist:
    - Constant integral value 0 and `nullptr` can convert to any pointer type.
    - Pointer to a non-const type can convert to `void*`.
    - Pointer to any type can convert to `const void*`.
    - (Discussed later) Pointer conversions for inheritance hierarchies.

**3. Conversions to `bool`:**

- Automatic conversion occurs from arithmetic or pointer types to `bool`.
    - Zero value results in `false`.
    - Any other value results in `true`.
- Example:
    - `char *cp = get_string(); if (cp) { ... } // true if cp is not null`

**4. Conversion to `const`:**

- Pointers and references to non-const types can be converted to corresponding `const` types.
    - `int i; const int &j = i; // j refers to a const int`
    - `int *p = &i; const int *q = p; // q points to a const int`
- Reverse conversion (removing low-level `const`) is not allowed.

**5. Class-Type Conversions:**

- Classes can define custom implicit conversions.
- The compiler applies at most one class-type conversion at a time.
- Examples:
    - C-style string to `std::string` object.
    - `istream` objects in conditions (`while (cin >> s)`).

**Explanation of `istream` to `bool` Conversion:**

- The condition `(cin >> s)` attempts to read from `cin` and stores the result (an `istream` object).
- Conditions require a `bool` value.
- The I/O library provides an implicit conversion from `istream` to `bool`.
- This conversion succeeds if the last read operation was successful (returns `true`).
- If the last read failed, the conversion yields `false`.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Explicit Conversions:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Purpose**: Explicitly force an object to convert to a different type.
  
- **Example Situation**:
  - Use floating-point division:
  
    ```cpp
    int i, j;
    double slope = i / j;
    ```
    
  - Need to explicitly convert `i` and/or `j` to `double`.

**Solution**: Use a **cast** to request an explicit conversion.

**Important Consideration**: 
  - Casts are inherently dangerous constructs and should be used cautiously.

## <font color="green0">Named Casts</f>

### <font color="pink">Introduction</f>

**Form**:

  ```cpp
  cast-name<type>(expression);
  ```
  
  - **type**: Target type of the conversion
  - **expression**: Value to be cast

**Behavior**:
  - If **type** is a reference, the result is an lvalue.

**Cast Names**:
  - **static_cast**
  - **dynamic_cast**
  - **const_cast**
  - **reinterpret_cast**

**Details**:
  - **dynamic_cast**: Supports run-time type identification (covered later).

 **Purpose**:
  - The **cast-name** determines the type of conversion performed.

### <font color="pink">static_cast</f>

**Purpose**: 
  - Performs well-defined type conversions.
  - Avoids low-level `const` changes.

**Usage**:
  - **Floating-point Division**: 
    ```cpp
    double slope = static_cast<double>(j) / i;
    ```
    - Forces floating-point division by casting one operand to `double`.

  - **Reducing Type Size**:
    - Useful when assigning larger arithmetic types to smaller ones.
    - Informs both the reader and the compiler of intentional precision loss.
    - Suppresses compiler warnings about potential data loss.

  - **Pointer Conversions**:
    ```cpp
    void* p = &d; 
    double* dp = static_cast<double*>(p);
    ```
    - Converts `void*` pointers back to their original types.
    - Guarantees preservation of the pointer value.
    - **Important**: Ensure the casted type matches the original type to avoid undefined behavior.

### <font color="pink">const_cast</f>

**Purpose**: 
  - Changes only the low-level `const` of its operand.

**Usage**:
  - **Casting Away Constness**: 
    ```cpp
    const char *pc;
    char *p = const_cast<char*>(pc); // OK: but writing through p is undefined
    ```
    - Converts a `const` object to a non-const type.
    - If the original object was not `const`, writing is legal; otherwise, it results in undefined behavior.
  
  - **Overloaded Functions**:
    - `const_cast` is useful in the context of overloaded functions.

  - **Restrictions**:
    - Only `const_cast` can change the constness of an expression.
    - Other casts like `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast` cannot change constness.
    - `const_cast` cannot be used to change the type of an expression.

  - **Examples of Incorrect Usage**:
    ```cpp
    const char *cp;
    // Error: static_cast cannot cast away const
    char *q = static_cast<char*>(cp);
    
    // OK: Converts string literal to string
    std::string s = static_cast<std::string>(cp);
    
    // Error: const_cast only changes constness, not the type
    std::string t = const_cast<std::string>(cp);
    ```

 **Usefulness**:
- **Overloaded Functions**: `const_cast` is particularly useful in the context of overloaded functions.

 **Summary**:
- **Key Point**: `const_cast` is the only cast that can change the constness of an object.
- **Use Case**: Primarily used for casting away constness to interact with overloaded functions or APIs that do not accept const objects.

### <font color="pink">reinterpret_cast</f>

**What is `reinterpret_cast`?**

- `reinterpret_cast` is a cast operator in C++ that performs a low-level conversion by reinterpreting the bit pattern of its operand(s).
- It bypasses type checking and allows converting between unrelated pointer types or integral types and pointer types.

**Example (and the Danger):**

```cpp
int *ip;
char *pc = reinterpret_cast<char*>(ip);
```

- Here, `ip` is an integer pointer, and `pc` is cast to a character pointer using `reinterpret_cast`.

**Why It's Dangerous:**

- Despite the cast, the memory pointed to by `pc` still holds an integer value, not a character.
- Using `pc` as a character pointer (e.g., `string str(pc);`) can lead to unexpected and potentially program-crashing behavior.

**Understanding the Risk:**

- `reinterpret_cast` bypasses compiler checks and warnings because you explicitly tell the compiler the conversion is intentional.
- The compiler doesn't know the underlying data type pointed to by `pc` after the cast. It assumes it's a character pointer based on its type.

**Difficulties in Debugging:**

- Issues caused by `reinterpret_cast` can be very hard to trace.
- The problematic cast might be in a separate file from where the converted pointer is used.

**Safety Considerations:**

- Using `reinterpret_cast` is inherently machine-dependent and requires a deep understanding of the involved types and how the compiler implements the cast.

**Summary:**

- Use `reinterpret_cast` with extreme caution and only when absolutely necessary.
- Consider alternative approaches that don't involve bypassing type safety.
- If you must use `reinterpret_cast`, ensure you fully grasp the implications and potential consequences.

**Remember:** There's often a safer way to achieve your goal without resorting to `reinterpret_cast`. Prioritize type safety and code clarity whenever possible.

## <font color="green0">Old-Style Casts</f>

**What are Old-Style Casts?**

- In earlier versions of C++, explicit type conversions used two notations:
    - `type (expr)` (function-style)
    - `(type) expr` (C-style)

**Behavior of Old-Style Casts:**

- Their behavior depends on the types involved:
    - May act like `const_cast`, `static_cast`, or `reinterpret_cast` depending on the context.
    - If `static_cast` or `const_cast` would be valid, the old-style cast behaves similarly.
    - If neither `static_cast` nor `const_cast` is legal, it performs a potentially risky `reinterpret_cast`.

**Example:**

```cpp
char *pc = (char*) ip; // ip is a pointer to int (might be reinterpret_cast)
```

**Why Avoid Old-Style Casts?**

- Less readable and harder to track compared to named casts (`static_cast`, etc.).
- Can interfere with type checking, potentially leading to errors.

**General Casting Advice:**

- **Minimize Casts:** Avoid casts whenever possible. They can bypass the compiler's type safety checks.
- **Particularly Avoid `reinterpret_cast`:** This cast can be very dangerous as it removes type information completely, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
- **Consider `const_cast` Only in Specific Scenarios:** This cast might be helpful in overloaded functions, but otherwise, it can indicate design issues.
- **Use `static_cast` and `dynamic_cast` Sparingly:** These casts should be used infrequently. Always consider alternative approaches before resorting to them.
- **Think Twice Before Casting:** If a cast seems necessary, explore alternative solutions.
- **Limit Scope and Document Assumptions (if unavoidable):** If a cast is truly unavoidable, limit its usage within a small scope and clearly document the type assumptions involved. This can help mitigate potential errors.

**Summary:**

Modern C++ encourages explicit type conversions using named casts like `static_cast` and `const_cast` for better readability and maintainability. Old-style casts are generally discouraged due to potential risks and reduced type safety. Remember, casting should be a last resort, and alternative approaches should be explored whenever possible.
