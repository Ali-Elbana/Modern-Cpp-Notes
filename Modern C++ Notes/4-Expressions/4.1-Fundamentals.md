**Operators:**

- C++ provides a rich set of built-in operators for various operations on data.
- The meaning of these operators is predefined for fundamental data types (e.g., integers, floats).
- Operators can be overloaded to define their behavior for custom class types (covered in Chapter 14).

**Expressions:**

- An #expression is a combination of operands and operators that evaluates to a single value.
- Simplest expressions:
    - Literals (e.g., `42`, `"hello"`)
    - Variables (e.g., `x`, `name`)
- More complex expressions involve operators and multiple operands.

**Fundamental Concepts for Evaluation:**

- This section provides a high-level overview of key concepts that influence expression evaluation (details explored later).

**Key Points:**

- Understanding operators and expressions is essential for writing C++ code.
- Built-in operators provide basic functionality for mathematical calculations, comparisons, and more.
- Expressions form the building blocks of computations and assignments in C++ programs.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Basic Concepts:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Operators** are fundamental building blocks in C++ that perform operations on values. There are several key types of operators to be aware of:

- **Unary Operators:** These operators act on a single operand. Examples include:
    - `&` (address-of): Gets the memory address of a variable.
    - `*` (dereference): Accesses the value stored at a memory address.
    - `++` (increment): Increases a value by 1.
    - `--` (decrement): Decreases a value by 1.
    - `!` (logical NOT): Inverts the logical truth value.
    - `-` (unary minus): Negates a value.
    
- **Binary Operators:** These operators take two operands and perform an operation on them. Examples include:
    - `+` (addition): Adds two numbers.
    - `-` (subtraction): Subtracts one number from another.
    - `*` (multiplication): Multiplies two numbers.
    - `/` (division): Divides one number by another.
    - `==` (equality): Compares two values for equality.
    - `!=` (inequality): Compares two values for inequality.
    - `&&` (logical AND): Performs logical AND operation.
    - `||` (logical OR): Performs logical OR operation.
    - `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` (comparison): Compare for less than, greater than, etc.
    
- **Ternary Operator:** This operator takes three operands and conditionally assigns a value based on a condition. Example:
    - `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`
    
- **Function Call Operator:** This operator allows calling a function with zero or more arguments.

**Symbol Overloading:**

- Some symbols, like `*`, can be used for both unary (dereference) and binary (multiplication) operations.
- The context determines the meaning of the symbol. You can think of them as separate operators based on the context.

**Example:**

```cpp
int x = 5;
int *ptr = &x; // Address-of operator (&) - unary
int y = *ptr;  // Dereference operator (*) - unary
int result = x * 2; // Multiplication operator (*) - binary
```

**Tips for Remembering Operators:**

- Understand the different types of operators (unary, binary, ternary).
- Be aware of symbol overloading and context-dependent meanings.
- Practice using operators in your code to solidify your understanding.

## <font color="green0">Grouping Operators and Operands</f>

**Challenge:** Evaluating expressions with multiple operators involves understanding:

- **Operator Precedence:** The order in which operations are performed. Higher precedence operators are evaluated first.
- **Associativity:** The direction in which operators with the same precedence are grouped (left to right or right to left).

**Example:**

```cpp
5 + 10 * 20 / 2;
```

Without proper understanding, the result can be ambiguous.

**Grouping Possibilities:**

- `(5 + 10) * 20 / 2` (15 * 20) / 2 = 150
- `5 + (10 * 20) / 2` = 5 + (200) / 2 = 105
- `5 + (10 * (20 / 2))` = 5 + (10 * 10) = 105
- `(5 + (10 * 2)) / 2` = (5 + 20) / 2 = 25 / 2 = 12.5 (assuming floating-point division)

**Next Steps:**

The following section will delve into operator precedence and associativity rules in C++ to clarify expression evaluation and avoid ambiguity.

## <font color="green0">Operand Conversions</f>

**Concept:**

During expression evaluation, operands (values being manipulated by operators) might undergo conversions to ensure compatibility.

**Common Scenario:**

- Binary operators (e.g., +, -, *, /) typically require operands of the same type.
- C++ allows operands of different types, but only if they can be converted to a common type according to built-in conversion rules.

**Conversion Rules:**

- Generally follow an intuitive logic.
- Examples:
    - Converting integers to floating-point for mixed-type arithmetic.
    - Converting characters to integers (their underlying numerical values).
- Not all conversions are allowed (e.g., pointers to floating-point).

**Promotion of Small Integral Types:**

- A surprising behavior: small integral types (e.g., `bool`, `char`, `short`) are often promoted to a larger integer type (usually `int`) during expression evaluation.

**Key Points:**

- Operand conversions are crucial for flexible expression evaluation.
- Understanding conversion rules helps write predictable and efficient C++ code.

## <font color="green0">Overloaded Operators</f>

**Concept:**

- C++ allows you to redefine the behavior of existing operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) for custom data types (classes).
- These redefined operators are called **overloaded operators**.

**Benefits:**

- Overloaded operators make code more readable and intuitive by using familiar operators for class-specific operations.
- They improve code maintainability by promoting a more natural syntax when working with custom data types.

**Examples:**

- The `<<` and `>>` operators used for input and output streams (e.g., `cin >> x`, `cout << y`) are overloaded operators.
- String concatenation (`+`) and comparison operators (`==`, `!=`) for strings are also examples of overloading.

**Key Points:**

- When using an overloaded operator, its meaning depends on the operand types and the definition provided for the class.
- The number of operands (e.g., unary or binary), precedence (order of operations), and associativity (left-to-right or right-to-left evaluation) of the original operator cannot be changed through overloading.

**In essence, operator overloading allows you to extend the functionality of existing operators to work seamlessly with your custom classes.**

## <font color="green0">Lvalues and Rvalues</f>

**Lvalues vs. Rvalues: Beyond Assignment**

In C++, every expression falls into one of two categories: lvalue (pronounced "ell-value") or rvalue (pronounced "are-value"). These terms originated from C and initially referred to expressions suitable for the left-hand side (lvalue) or right-hand side (rvalue) of an assignment.

While assignment remains a key concept, C++ offers a more nuanced view:

- **Lvalues:** Represent objects or functions. They generally denote a memory location.
    
    - Not all lvalues can be assigned to (e.g., `const` objects).
    - Some expressions yielding objects might return them as rvalues (not lvalues).
    - Using an lvalue as an rvalue implies using its value (contents).
    - Using an lvalue as an lvalue implies using its identity (memory location).
    
- **Rvalues:** Represent the actual value of an expression. They are typically used on the right-hand side of an assignment or as operands for functions.
    
    - Using an rvalue in place of an lvalue (e.g., attempting to assign to a literal) is generally not allowed.

**Operator Considerations:**

- Operators differ in their requirements for lvalue/rvalue operands and their return types (lvalue/rvalue).
- **Generally:** You can use an lvalue where an rvalue is expected, but not vice versa.

**Examples of Lvalue Operators:**

- **Assignment:** Requires a non-const lvalue on the left-hand side (e.g., `x = 5`).
- **Address-of (`&`):** Takes an lvalue operand and returns a pointer to that operand as an rvalue (e.g., `&x`).
- **Dereference (`*`), Subscript (`[]`), Iterator Dereference, String/Vector Subscript:** All yield lvalues (e.g., `*p`, `arr[2]`).
- **Prefix Increment/Decrement (`++`, `--`):** Require lvalue operands and return lvalues (e.g., `++i`).

**Impact on `decltype`:**

- `decltype` applied to an expression (excluding variables) results in a reference type if the expression is an lvalue.
- Example: `int* p; decltype(*p) is int&` (dereference yields lvalue, so reference type returned).

**Key Takeaway:**

Lvalues and rvalues are fundamental concepts in C++ expression evaluation and understanding operator behavior. While assignment is a common use case, understanding their relationship helps you write correct and efficient code.

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Compound Expressions:**

- Expressions involving multiple operators are considered compound expressions.
- Evaluating these expressions requires grouping operands with appropriate operators.

**Precedence and Associativity:**

- These concepts determine how operands are grouped in a compound expression.
    - **Precedence:** Defines the order of operations. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.
    - **Associativity:** Defines how operators with the same precedence are grouped. Left-associative operators are grouped from left to right, while right-associative ones are grouped from right to left.

**Overriding Rules:**

- Parentheses can be used to override default precedence and associativity, forcing specific grouping.

**Impact on Expression Values:**

- The order of evaluation significantly affects the final value of a compound expression. Higher-precedence and left-to-right grouping lead to earlier evaluations on the left side.

**Examples:**

- **Precedence:** `3 + 4 * 5` evaluates to 23 (multiplication happens first due to higher precedence).
- **Associativity:** `20 - 15 - 3` evaluates to 2 (subtractions are grouped left to right due to left associativity).

**Complex Example:**

- `6 + 3 * 4 / 2 + 2` evaluates to 14 due to default precedence and associativity:
    - `((6 + ((3 * 4) / 2)) + 2)` (parentheses based on default rules)

**Incorrect Interpretations:**

- Some might interpret the example as 9, 14, or 36 depending on assumed (incorrect) associativity. In C++, it's 14.

**Key Points:**

- Understand operator precedence and associativity for accurate evaluation.
- Use parentheses for clarity or to enforce a specific evaluation order.
- Be mindful of potential confusion with complex expressions.

## <font color="green0">Parentheses Override Precedence and Associativity</f>

**Precedence and Associativity:**

- C++ uses operator precedence and associativity to determine the order in which expressions are evaluated.
- Precedence defines which operators are evaluated first.
- Associativity specifies how operands are grouped when multiple operators have the same precedence.

**Parentheses for Overriding Order:**

- Parentheses can be used to override the default evaluation order.
- Any expression within parentheses is treated as a single unit and evaluated first.

**Example:**

```cpp
int expression = 6 + 3 * 4 / 2 + 2; // Default evaluation (9)
```

Without parentheses, the expression evaluates to 9 due to multiplication and division having higher precedence than addition and subtraction (left-to-right associativity).

**Impact of Parentheses:**

```cpp
cout << (6 + 3) * (4 / 2 + 2) << endl; // Prints 36
cout << ((6 + 3) * 4) / 2 + 2 << endl; // Prints 20
cout << 6 + 3 * 4 / (2 + 2) << endl; // Prints 9
```

- `(6 + 3) * (4 / 2 + 2)`: Evaluates 6 + 3 first (9), then 4 / 2 + 2 (3), and finally 9 * 3 (27).
- `((6 + 3) * 4) / 2 + 2`: Evaluates 6 + 3 first (9), then 9 * 4 (36), then 36 / 2 (18), and finally 18 + 2 (20).
- `6 + 3 * 4 / (2 + 2)`: Default evaluation order remains (9).

**Key Point:**

- Parentheses provide control over the evaluation sequence, allowing you to achieve different results from the same expression.

## <font color="green0">When Precedence and Associativity Matter</f>

**Impact on Correctness:**

Operator precedence and associativity are crucial aspects of C++ expressions that determine the order of operations and how they are evaluated. Incorrect usage can lead to unexpected program behavior.

**Precedence Example: Dereference and Pointer Arithmetic**

Consider the array declaration:

```cpp
int ia[] = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};
```

- **Correct Access:**

    ```cpp
    int last = *(ia + 4); // initializes last to 8 (value of ia[4])
    ```
    
    - Parentheses are essential. The expression evaluates `ia + 4` first, resulting in a pointer to the fifth element. Then, `*` dereferences the pointer to access the value at that memory location.
- **Incorrect Access (without parentheses):**
 
    ```cpp
    last = *ia + 4; // last = 4 (equivalent to ia[0] + 4)
    ```
    
    - Due to precedence, `*ia` is evaluated first. It dereferences `ia`, resulting in the value at the first element (0). Then, 4 is added to 0, leading to an incorrect final value of 4.

**Associativity Example: Input/Output Operations**

- Input/output operators are left-associative. This means operations are grouped from left to right:
 
    ```cpp
    cin >> v1 >> v2; // Reads into v1 and then into v2
    ```
    
    - `cin >> v1` is performed first, storing user input in `v1`. Then, `cin >> v2` reads subsequent input and stores it in `v2`.

**Key Points:**

- Understand operator precedence to determine the order of evaluation.
- Use parentheses when necessary to override default precedence and ensure correct evaluation.
- Be aware of operator associativity (left-to-right or right-to-left) to group expressions appropriately.

**By mastering these concepts, you can write more predictable and reliable C++ code.**

## <font color="yellow"><u>Order of Evaluation:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Precedence vs. Order:**

- Precedence defines how expressions are grouped for evaluation (e.g., multiplication happening before addition within the same expression).
- Order of evaluation, however, specifies the sequence in which individual operands are evaluated within a group.

**General Rule (Most Operators):**

- The order of evaluation for most operators is **unspecified**.
- The compiler has freedom in determining the sequence as long as it adheres to the precedence rules.

**Example:**

```cpp
int i = f1() * f2();
```

- We know `f1` and `f2` must be called before multiplication, but the order of those calls is not guaranteed (either `f1` then `f2` or vice versa).

**Undefined Behavior with Side Effects:**

- Expressions with side effects (modifying the same object) on operands with unspecified evaluation order can lead to undefined behavior.
- The compiler cannot determine the correct sequence of operations in such cases.

**Example (Undefined Behavior):**

```c++
int i = 0;
cout << i << " " << ++i << endl; // Undefined behavior
```

- The outcome is unpredictable because the order of evaluation for `i` and `++i` is not guaranteed.
- The output could be `1 1` or `0 1` depending on the compiler's choice, or something entirely different.

**Guaranteed Evaluation Order Operators:**

- **Logical AND (&&):** Left operand is evaluated first. Right operand is evaluated only if the left operand is true (short-circuit evaluation).
- **Logical OR (||):** Left operand is evaluated first. Right operand is evaluated only if the left operand is false (short-circuit evaluation).
- **Conditional (?:):** Evaluates the condition first, then either the true or false expression based on the result.
- **Comma (,):** Left operand is evaluated first, then the right operand (the value of the entire expression is the value of the right operand).

**Key Points:**

- Understanding order of evaluation is crucial to avoid unexpected behavior in C++.
- Be cautious with side effects in expressions where order is unspecified.
- Use guaranteed-order operators when necessary for predictable outcomes.

## <font color="green0">Order of Evaluation, Precedence, and Associativity</f>

**Key Concepts:**

- **Precedence:** Determines the order of operations in an expression when multiple operators have different priorities. (e.g., multiplication has higher precedence than addition).
- **Associativity:** Determines how to group operands when multiple operators have the same precedence. (e.g., left-to-right associativity for addition and subtraction).
- **Order of Evaluation:** Independent of precedence and associativity. The compiler can choose the evaluation order for operands within the same precedence level and associativity rule.

**Example:** `f() + g() * h() + j()`

- **Precedence:** `g()` and `h()` are multiplied first (higher precedence).
- **Associativity:** `f()` is added to the product of `g()` and `h()` (left-to-right). The result is then added to `j()`.
- **Order of Evaluation:** The compiler can decide the order in which `f()`, `g()`, `h()`, and `j()` are called, as long as the evaluation adheres to precedence and associativity.

**Impact of Order on Independent Functions:**

- If `f()`, `g()`, `h()`, and `j()` are independent functions without side effects, the order of evaluation doesn't affect the result.

**Impact of Order with Side Effects:**

- If any of these functions modify the same objects or perform input/output (side effects), the order becomes crucial. In such cases, the expression has undefined behavior (the outcome is unpredictable).

**Tips for Managing Complex Expressions:**

1. **Parentheses:** Use parentheses to enforce the grouping you intend for clarity and avoid ambiguity.
2. **Operand Modification:** Avoid modifying an operand within the same expression if it's used elsewhere. This helps prevent unexpected behavior due to unknown evaluation order.

**Exception: Safe Modification:**

- In some cases, modifying an operand within a subexpression that's part of another subexpression is acceptable. For example, `*++iter`:
    - The increment changes `iter`'s value.
    - The dereference operator uses the (now modified) value of `iter`.
    - Order of evaluation doesn't matter here because the increment must happen before the dereference.

**In essence:**

- Precedence and associativity guide the evaluation of operators, while order of evaluation (within the same precedence level) is flexible for the compiler.
- Be mindful of side effects when dealing with functions that modify objects or perform I/O to avoid undefined behavior.
- Parenthesize and avoid modification within expressions for better control and clarity.
