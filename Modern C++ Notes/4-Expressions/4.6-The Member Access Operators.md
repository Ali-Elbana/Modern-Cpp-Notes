**Dot (.) and Arrow (->) Operators**

These operators are used to access members (variables or functions) of objects in C++.

- **Dot Operator (.)**
    - Used with objects (variables of class type).
    - Syntax: `object.member`
    - Example: `string s1 = "hello"; int length = s1.size();` (accesses `size` member of `s1`).
    
- **Arrow Operator (->)**
    - Used with pointers to objects.
    - Syntax: `pointer->member`
    - Equivalent to: `(*pointer).member` (dereference the pointer first, then access the member).
    - Example: `string s1 = "hello"; string* p = &s1; int length = p->size();` (accesses `size` member of the object pointed to by `p`).

**Precedence and Parentheses:**

- Dereference (`*`) has lower precedence than the dot operator.
- Parentheses are crucial to avoid errors.
    - Correct: `p->size()` (accesses `size` member of the object pointed to by `p`).
    - Incorrect: `*p.size()` (attempts to access `size` member of the pointer `p` itself, which is an error).

**Key Points:**

- Arrow operator requires a pointer operand and returns an **lvalue** (modifiable).
- Dot operator's return value (lvalue or rvalue) depends on the object being accessed (lvalue for objects, rvalue for temporary expressions).

**Example of Incorrect Usage:**

```cpp
string s1 = "hello";
string* p = &s1;
int length = *p.size(); // Error: attempts to access size member of the pointer p
```

This code will result in a compilation error because `*p` tries to dereference the pointer `p` (which is not an object) and then access a member named `size`. Since pointers don't have members, this is invalid.
