## <font color="yellow"><u>Chapter Summary Notes:</u></f>

**Overview:**

- C++ defines a rich set of operators for built-in types and allows operator overloading for user-defined types.
- Understanding operators involves knowing precedence, associativity, and operand evaluation order.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Precedence:** Determines grouping of operators in expressions; higher precedence operators are evaluated first.
- **Associativity:** Specifies the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated (left to right or right to left).
- **Operand Evaluation:** Compiler may evaluate operands in any order unless specified by short-circuiting operators.
- **Automatic Conversions:** Convert operands to related types (e.g., integral promotions).

**Defined Terms**:

1. **Arithmetic Conversion:** Preserves precision by converting smaller types to larger types in arithmetic operations.
2. **Associativity:** Determines how operators of the same precedence are grouped (left or right associative).
3. **Binary Operators:** Operators that take two operands.
4. **Cast:** Explicit type conversion.
5. **Compound Expression:** Involves multiple operators.
6. **Const_cast:** Converts between const and non-const types.
7. **Conversion:** Transforming a value from one type to another.
8. **Dynamic_cast:** Used with inheritance for runtime type identification.
9. **Expression:** Lowest computation level in C++, applies an operator to operands.
10. **Implicit Conversion:** Compiler-generated conversion between types.
11. **Integral Promotions:** Converts smaller integral types to larger types.
12. **Lvalue:** Expression yielding an object or function.
13. **Operands:** Values on which operators operate.
14. **Operator:** Symbol defining actions in expressions, overloaded for class types.
15. **Order of Evaluation:** Sequence in which operands are evaluated.
16. **Overloaded Operator:** Operator redefined for class types.
17. **Precedence:** Order of operators in expressions.
18. **Result:** Value obtained from evaluating an expression.
19. **Rvalue:** Expression yielding a value but not its location.
20. **Short-circuit Evaluation:** Logical operators stop evaluating once the result is determined.
21. **Sizeof:** Operator returning size in bytes of an object.
22. **Static_cast:** Explicit and safe type conversion.
23. **Unary Operators:** Operators taking a single operand.
24. **Comma Operator (,):** Evaluates left to right, result is right-hand operand.
25. **Conditional Operator (?:):** Provides if-then-else functionality.
26. **Logical AND (&&):** Returns true if both operands are true.
27. **Bitwise AND (&):** Bitwise AND operation.
28. **Bitwise XOR (Ë†):** Bitwise exclusive OR operation.
29. **Logical OR (||):** Returns true if either operand is true.
30. **Bitwise OR (|):** Bitwise OR operation.
31. **Increment (++, --):** Adds or subtracts 1 from operand.
32. **Left Shift (<<):** Shifts bits left.
33. **Right Shift (>>):** Shifts bits right.
34. **Bitwise NOT (~):** Bitwise NOT operation.
35. **Logical NOT (!):** Logical NOT operation.
