## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

**Introduction:**

- Bitwise operators manipulate individual bits within integer values.
- They provide fine-grained control over binary representation of data.
- While these operators can work with signed or unsigned integers, there are important considerations for signed types.

**Supported Types:**

- Integers (both signed and unsigned).
- `bitset` (a library type for flexible bit manipulation).

**Promotion of Small Integers:**

- If an operand is a "small integer" (type with limited size), its value is automatically promoted to a larger integer type before the operation.

**Operator Summary:**

| Operator | Function    | Use                                                                                                            |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT | Inverts all bits (1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1).                                                                   |
| `<<`     | Left Shift  | Shifts bits left by the specified number of positions (zeros fill in from the right).                          |
| `>>`     | Right Shift | Shifts bits right by the specified number of positions (behavior for signed right shift is machine-dependent). |
| `&`      | Bitwise AND | Sets each bit to 1 only if the corresponding bits in both operands are 1.                                      |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR | Sets each bit to 1 if the corresponding bits in the operands are different.                                    |
| \|       | Bitwise OR  | Sets each bit to 1 if either or both operands contain 1.                                                       |

**Caution with Signed Integers:**

- The behavior of bitwise operators with signed integers, especially regarding the sign bit, can vary depending on the system architecture.
- To avoid undefined behavior and ensure consistent results, it's strongly recommended to use unsigned integer types for bitwise operations.

**Additional Notes:**

- Understanding bitwise operators can be beneficial for low-level programming tasks, bit manipulation algorithms, and working with binary data formats.

**Remember:** Using unsigned integers and being aware of potential signed integer pitfalls is crucial for safe and reliable bitwise operations in C++.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Bitwise Shift Operators:</u></f>

**Beyond Input/Output:**

- C++ provides built-in bitwise shift operators (`<<` and `>>`) for manipulating individual bits within integer values.
- These operators differ from the overloaded versions used for input/output operations.

**Functionality:**

- Bitwise shift operators perform a shift operation on their operands.
- The left operand (often promoted to a larger integer) is shifted based on the value of the right operand.

**Shift Direction:**

- `<<` (left shift): Shifts bits to the left. Discarded bits are replaced with zeros.
- `>>` (right shift): Shifts bits to the right. The behavior for signed right shift depends on the operand type.

**Operand Requirements:**

- The right operand (number of positions to shift) must be non-negative.
- It must also be strictly less than the number of bits in the result. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

**Examples (Assuming 8 bits for char and 32 bits for int):**

```cpp
unsigned char bits = 0233;  // Binary: 10011011

// Left shift by 8 bits (bits promoted to int)
bits << 8;  // Binary: 00000000 00000000 00000000 10011011 (zeros fill in)

// Left shift by 31 bits (leftmost bits discarded)
bits << 31;  // Binary: 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 (undefined behavior)

// Right shift by 3 bits (unsigned, zeros fill in on the left)
bits >> 3;  // Binary: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001001
```

**Important Note on Right Shift:**

- The behavior of right shift for signed types is implementation-defined.
    - <font color="red">It might replicate the sign bit (arithmetic right shift) or insert zeros (logical right shift)</font>.
- To ensure consistent results, it's recommended to use unsigned integers for bitwise shift operations or explicitly cast signed values to unsigned before the shift.

**Applications:**

- Bitwise shifts are used in various scenarios where bit manipulation is needed, such as:
    - Extracting specific bits from a value.
    - Implementing simple data compression techniques.
    - Working with low-level binary data formats.

**Remember:** Understanding bitwise shifts empowers you to control data at the bit level, opening doors for advanced programming techniques. Be mindful of signed integer behavior when using right shift.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Bitwise NOT Operator:</u></f>

The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) performs a logical negation on each bit of its operand, essentially flipping the bits.

**Functionality:**

- Each bit that is 1 becomes 0.
- Each bit that is 0 becomes 1.

**Example:**

```cpp
unsigned char bits = 0227; // Binary representation: 10010111
~bits;                   // Bitwise NOT operation
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Promotion:** The `unsigned char` operand (`bits`) is first promoted to an `int` type. This promotion doesn't change the value itself (0227) but adds 24 zero bits to the higher-order positions in the memory representation.
    
2. **Bitwise NOT:** The NOT operation is applied to each bit in the promoted `int` value.
    
    ```
    Before NOT:  00000000 00000000 00000000 10010111 (promoted to int)
    After NOT:   11111111 11111111 11111111 01101000
    ```
    
3. **Result:** Only the lower 8 bits (original `unsigned char`) are relevant. The result is the bitwise complement of `bits`, which is 01101000 in binary (equivalent to decimal 96).
    

**Key Points:**

- Remember the promotion step when working with smaller integer types like `char`.
- The NOT operation only affects the bits within the original operand's size, not the additional bits added during promotion.

**Applications:**

- Bitwise NOT is useful for tasks like:
    - Setting all bits to 0 (inverting all bits).
    - Isolating specific bits by inverting them and then performing a bitwise AND with the original value.
    - Implementing simple logical negation in bitwise operations.

By understanding the bitwise NOT operator and its behavior, you can manipulate data at the bit level for various low-level programming tasks.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Bitwise AND, OR, and XOR Operators:</u></f>

**Understanding Binary Representation:**

These operators work on the individual bits of unsigned integer values (like `unsigned char`). Each operator generates a new value based on how corresponding bits in the operands are combined.

**Example:**

```cpp
unsigned char b1 = 0145; // Binary: 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
unsigned char b2 = 0257; // Binary: 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1
```

**Bitwise AND (&):**

- Sets each bit in the result to 1 **only if** the corresponding bits in both operands are 1.
- Otherwise, the result bit is 0.

```cpp
b1 & b2 = 001 (Binary: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1)
```

**Bitwise OR (|):**

- Sets each bit in the result to 1 **if at least one** of the corresponding bits in the operands is 1.
- Otherwise, the result bit is 0.

```cpp
b1 | b2 = 367 (Binary: 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1)
```

**Bitwise XOR (^):**

- Sets each bit in the result to 1 **if the corresponding bits in the operands are different**.
- If both bits are the same (either 0 or 1), the result bit is 0.

```cpp
b1 ^ b2 = 312 (Binary: 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0)
```

**Caution: Avoiding Confusion with Logical Operators:**

- A common pitfall is mistaking bitwise operators for logical operators (`&&`, `||`, and `!`).
- Remember, bitwise operators work on individual bits, while logical operators perform comparisons based on truth values (true or false).

**Key Points:**

- Bitwise AND, OR, and XOR offer powerful tools for bit-level manipulation.
- Understanding their behavior is crucial for tasks like low-level programming, data encryption, and working with binary data formats.
- Distinguishing them from logical operators is essential to avoid errors in your code.

#### Tracking Student Quiz Results with Bitwise Operators

**Scenario:**

Imagine a class of 30 students taking weekly pass/fail quizzes. We'll use bit manipulation to track their results.

**Data Structure:**

- `unsigned long quiz1`: This variable stores the results of one quiz, with each bit representing a student (32 bits for at least 30 students).
- We initialize `quiz1` to `0` to ensure well-defined initial values.

**Setting a Pass:**

- To record a pass for student 27, we create a value with only bit 27 set:
    
    ```cpp
    1UL << 27  // Left-shift 1 (unsigned long) 27 positions (bit 27 becomes 1)
    ```
    
- Bitwise OR (`|=`) this value with `quiz1` to set the corresponding bit:
    
    ```cpp
    quiz1 |= 1UL << 27  // Set bit 27 in quiz1 (student 27 passed)
    ```
    

**Correcting a Pass to Fail:**

- To change student 27's result to fail, we need a value with all bits on except bit 27:
    - Invert the previous value (which had only bit 27 set) using bitwise NOT (`~`).
- Bitwise AND (`&=`) this inverted value with `quiz1` to turn off bit 27:
    
    ```cpp
    quiz1 &= ~(1UL << 27);  // Turn off bit 27 in quiz1 (student 27 failed)
    ```
    

**Checking Student Status:**

- To determine if student 27 passed:
    
    ```cpp
    bool status = quiz1 & (1UL << 27);  // Check if bit 27 is set in quiz1
    ```
    
    - This ANDs `quiz1` with a value having only bit 27 set.
    - The result is non-zero (true) if bit 27 in `quiz1` is also 1 (passed), otherwise zero (failed).

**Benefits of Bitwise Operators:**

- Efficient storage: 1 bit per student is space-saving for large classes.
- Fast manipulation: Bitwise operations are efficient for setting, clearing, or checking individual bits.

**Remember:**

- Use unsigned integers for bitwise operations to avoid sign-related issues.
- Understand bit positions and shifting to manipulate specific bits.
- Bitwise operators provide powerful tools for low-level programming and data manipulation.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Shift Operators (aka IO Operators) Are Left Associative:</u></f>

**Shift Operators and Input/Output (I/O):**

While bitwise operators might not be used directly by many programmers, their overloaded versions for I/O operations (`<<` for insertion and `>>` for extraction) are quite common. These overloaded operators inherit the precedence and associativity of their built-in counterparts.

**Left Associativity Matters:**

The shift operators are left associative, meaning evaluation proceeds from left to right. This order of evaluation impacts how expressions with multiple `<<` operators are interpreted.

**Example: cout Chain with Left Associativity:**

```cpp
cout << "hi" << " there" << endl;
```

This statement is evaluated as:

```cpp
( (cout << "hi") << " there" ) << endl;
```

- `cout << "hi"` is evaluated first, sending "hi" to the output stream.
- The result of the first `<<` (which is `cout`), along with " there", is passed to the second `<<`.
- Finally, the combined output is sent to the output stream with the `endl` manipulator.

**Precedence Levels:**

- Shift operators have medium precedence, lower than arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) but higher than relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), assignment (`=`), and conditional (`?:`) operators.
- This hierarchy often requires parentheses to ensure the desired order of evaluation.

**Examples:**

- **Correct Grouping:**
    
    ```cpp
    cout << 42 + 10; // OK: + has higher precedence, 42 and 10 are added first
    cout << (10 < 42); // OK: Parentheses force evaluation of 10 < 42 before printing
    ```
    
- **Incorrect Grouping (Compilation Error):**
    
    ```cpp
    cout << 10 < 42; // Error: Attempt to compare cout to 42
    ```
    
    - This is misinterpreted as `(cout << 10) < 42`, trying to compare the output stream (`cout`) with an integer.

**Key Points:**

- Understanding shift operator associativity is crucial for writing correct I/O statements with multiple insertion (`<<`) operations.
- Precedence levels determine the order of evaluation within expressions.
- Use parentheses to enforce the desired order, especially when mixing operators with different precedence.
