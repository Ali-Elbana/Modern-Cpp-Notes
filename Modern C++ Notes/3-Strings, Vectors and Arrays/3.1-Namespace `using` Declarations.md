**What are they?**

- A way to use library names without the `std::` prefix.
- More convenient than using the scope operator (`::`) every time.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
using namespace::name;
```

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main() {
  // ...
}
```

**Important points:**

- Each `using` declaration introduces a single name.
- Use them for specific names you want to use without the prefix.
- Avoid using `using` declarations in headers to prevent conflicts.

**Additional notes:**

- You can use `using` on its own line or combine several on a single line.
- Remember to end each declaration with a semicolon.
