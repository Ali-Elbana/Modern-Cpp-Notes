## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

- Strings are variable-length sequences of characters.
- To use the string type, include the `<string>` header.
- `string` is defined in the `std` namespace.
- Common string operations will be covered in this note.
- Additional operations are covered later.

**Example Code:**

```cpp
#include <string>
using std::string;
```

## <font color="yellow"><u>String Initialization:</u></f>

**Key Points:**

- **Default Initialization:** Creates an empty string with no characters.
- **Copy Initialization:** Creates a copy of another string or string literal.
    - `string s2 = s1;`
    - `string s3 = "hiya";`
- **Direct Initialization:** Creates a string with specific values.
    - `string s4(10, 'c');` (10 copies of 'c')
- **Copy Form with Temporary Object:** Less efficient and less readable.
    - `string s8 = string(10, 'c');`

**<font color="red">Table:</font>**

| Initialization Method | Example                              | Description                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `string s1;`          | Empty string                         | Default initialization                         |
| `string s2(s1);`      | `s2` is a copy of `s1`               | Copy initialization from another string        |
| `string s2 = s1;`     | `s2` is a copy of `s1`               | Copy initialization from another string        |
| `string s3("value");` | `s3` is a copy of the string literal | Direct initialization from string literal      |
| `string s3 ="value";` | `s3` is a copy of the string literal | Direct initialization from string literal      |
| `string s4(n, 'c');`  | `s4` is `n` copies of `c`            | Direct initialization with count and character |

## <font color="yellow"><u>Operations on strings:</u></f>

**Key Points:**

- Classes define operations that objects of the class type can perform.
- These operations can be:
    - Named functions (e.g., `isbn` function in `Sales_item` class)
    - Applied using operator symbols (e.g., `<<` for printing, `+` for concatenation)
- Table below ðŸ‘‡ lists the most common string operations.

## <font color="green0">Reading and Writing strings</f>

### <font color="pink">Introduction</f>

**Key Points:**

- Use `iostream` library for reading and writing strings.
- `cin >> s`: Reads whitespace-separated string into `s`.
- `cout << s`: Writes string `s` to output.
- `getline(is, s)`: Reads entire line of input into `s`.
- `s.empty()`: Checks if string `s` is empty.
- `s.size()`: Returns the number of characters in `s`.
- `s[n]`: Accesses the character at position `n` in `s`.
- `s1 + s2`: Concatenates strings `s1` and `s2`.
- `s1 = s2`: Replaces characters in `s1` with `s2`.
- `s1 == s2`: String comparisons are case-sensitive and use dictionary ordering.

**Example:**

```cpp
string s1, s2;
cin >> s1 >> s2; // Read two strings
cout << s1 << s2 << endl; // Write both strings
```

**Note:** Remember to include necessary headers (`#include <iostream>` and `#include <string>`) for the code to compile.

### <font color="pink">Reading an Unknown Number of strings</f>

**Key Points:**

- **Similar to reading integers:** This code works similarly to reading an unknown number of integers, but instead of using `int`, it uses `string` to read strings.
- **`while (cin >> word)`:** This loop continues as long as the input stream (`cin`) is valid and can successfully read a string into the `word` variable.
- **End-of-file or invalid input:** When the end-of-file is reached or invalid input is encountered, the loop terminates.
- **Printing each word:** Inside the loop, the read word is printed to the standard output (`cout`) followed by a new line (`endl`).

**Example Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::string word;
  while (std::cin >> word) {
    std::cout << word << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

### <font color="pink">Using getline to Read an Entire Line</f>

**Purpose:**

- Read an entire line of input, including whitespace, into a string variable.

**Function:**

- `getline(istream& input_stream, string& str)`

**Parameters:**

- `input_stream`: The input stream to read from (e.g., `cin`)
- `str`: The string variable to store the read line

**Behavior:**

- Reads characters from the input stream until a newline character (`\n`) is encountered.
- Stores the read characters (excluding the newline) in the `str` variable.
- Returns the input stream (`input_stream`) after reading the line.

**Key Points:**

- Useful for reading multi-word or multi-line input.
- Can be used in a `while` loop to read multiple lines until end-of-file.
- Remember to add `endl` after printing the line to flush the buffer and move to the next line.
- The newline character is discarded and not stored in the string.

**Example:**

```cpp
int main()
{
	string line;
	// read input a line at a time until end-of-file
	while (getline(cin, line))
	cout << line << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

## <font color="green0">The string empty and size Operations</f>

### <font color="pink">Introduction</f>

**empty() function:**

- Checks if a string is empty (contains no characters).
- Returns a `bool` value: `true` if empty, `false` otherwise.
- Called using the dot operator on a string object: `string_name.empty()`.

**Example:**

```cpp
// read input a line at a time and discard blank lines
while (getline(cin, line))
	if (!line.empty())
		cout << line << endl;
```

**size() member:**

- Returns the length of a string (number of characters).
- Can be used to filter strings based on length.

**Example:**

```cpp
string line;
// read input a line at a time and print lines that are longer than 80 characters
while (getline(cin, line))
	if (line.size() > 80)
		cout << line << endl;
```

**Additional Notes:**

- `empty()` is more efficient than `size() == 0` for checking emptiness.
- The logical NOT operator (`!`) inverts the boolean value of its operand.

### <font color="pink">The string::size_type Type</f>

**Key Points:**

- The `size()` member function of the `string` class returns the number of characters in a string.
- The return type of `size()` is `string::size_type`, not an `int` or `unsigned`.
- `string::size_type` is an unsigned integer type large enough to hold the size of any string on the system.
- Using `string::size_type` ensures machine-independent code and avoids potential issues with signed/unsigned conversions.
- New C++ standards allow using `auto` or `decltype` to automatically determine the correct type:

```cpp
auto len = line.size(); // len has type string::size_type
```

**Caution:**

- Be careful when comparing `string::size_type` with signed integer types (e.g., `int`) as negative signed values can convert to large unsigned values, leading to unexpected results.

**Additional Notes:**

- `string::size_type` is typically defined as `size_t` in most C++ implementations.

## <font color="green0">Compare strings</f>

**Key Points:**

- **Operators:** The `string` class provides operators for comparing strings:
    - `==`: Checks for equality (same length and characters)
    - `!=`: Checks for inequality (not equal)
    - `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`: Lexicographic comparison (dictionary order)
- **Case-Sensitivity:** Comparisons are case-sensitive.
- **Comparison Rules:**
    1. **Length Difference:** Shorter string is less than longer string if all characters match.
    2. **First Difference:** If characters differ at any position, the comparison stops and the result is based on the first differing character.

**Example:**

- `string str = "Hello";`
- `string phrase = "Hello World";`
- `string slang = "Hiya";`
- `str < phrase` (rule 1)
- `slang > str` and `slang > phrase` (rule 2)

Hereâ€™s how you can see this in code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string str = "Hello";
    std::string phrase = "Hello World";
    std::string slang = "Hiya";
     
    std::cout << std::boolalpha; // print bool values as true/false
    
    std::cout << "str < phrase: " << (str < phrase) << '\n'; // prints: true
    std::cout << "slang > str: " << (slang > str) << '\n'; // prints: true
    std::cout << "slang > phrase: " << (slang > phrase) << '\n'; // prints: true
    
    return 0;
}
```

This program will outputÂ `true`Â for all comparisons, confirming our analysis.

## <font color="green0">Assignment for strings</f>

**Key Points:**

- **Library Types and Assignment:** Modern C++ library types aim to be as user-friendly as built-in types. This includes support for assignment operations.
- **String Assignment:** String objects can be assigned to each other, replacing the original content with a copy.
- 
**Example:**

```cpp
string st1(10, 'c'); // st1 is "ccccccccc"
string st2;         // st2 is an empty string    
st1 = st2;         // Assigns an empty string to st1

// Now both st1 and st2 are empty strings
```

**Additional Notes:**

- The assignment operator creates a copy of the assigned string, not a reference.
- Be mindful of potential memory management issues when working with large strings.

## <font color="green0">Adding Two strings</f>

**Adding Two Strings**

- The `+` operator concatenates strings, creating a new string.
- The resulting string contains the characters of the left-hand operand followed by the characters of the right-hand operand.

**Example:**

```cpp
string s1 = "hello, ";
string s2 = "world\n";
string s3 = s1 + s2; // s3 is "hello, world\n"
```

**Compound Assignment Operator (+=)**

- Appends the right-hand operand to the left-hand string.
- Equivalent to `s1 = s1 + s2;`

**Example:**

```cpp
s1 += s2; // s1 is now "hello, world\n"
```

## <font color="green0">Adding Literals and strings</f>

**Key Points:**

- **Implicit Conversions:**
    - Can use one type where another is expected if there's a conversion.
    - String library allows conversion of character and string literals to strings.
- **String Concatenation:**
    - Use `+` operator to concatenate strings.
    - <font color="red">At least one operand to each `+` must be of string type</font>.
- **Mixing Literals and Strings:**
    - Can mix strings and string literals, <font color="red">but not string literals alone</font>.
- **Chaining Operations:**
    - Expressions can be chained together, similar to input/output.
- **Important Note:**
    - String literals are not standard library strings (historical reasons, C compatibility).
    - Remember the difference when using string literals and library strings.

**Examples:**

- **Valid:**
    - `string s1 = "hello", s2 = "world";`
    - `string s4 = s1 + ", ";`
    - `string s6 = (s1 + ", ") + "world";`
- **Invalid:**
    - `string s5 = "hello" + ", ";` (no string operand)
    - `string s7 = "hello" + ", " + s2;` (cannot add string literals)

**Explanation:**

- Simple initializations like `s4` and `s5` are straightforward, so it's easy to whether it's legal or illegal.
- Chaining expressions like `s6` uses the `+` operator to combine strings.
    - It works by creating a temporary string with `s1 + ", "` and then concatenating it with "world".
- Direct addition of string literals like in `s7` is illegal.
    - Parenthesization reveals the error: `("hello" + ", ") + s2` attempts to add two string literals, which is not allowed.

**Key Takeaway:**

Be mindful of expression order and operator precedence when working with string initializations in Modern C++.

**In Summary:**

- Be mindful of type conversions when using literals and strings.
- Understand the rules for string concatenation.
- Remember the distinction between string literals and standard library strings.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Dealing with the Characters in a string:</u></f>

**Key Points:**

- We often need to manipulate individual characters in strings (e.g., check for whitespace, convert to lowercase, search for specific characters).
- Processing involves:
    - Accessing characters: sometimes all, sometimes specific ones, sometimes stopping based on conditions.
    - Knowing/changing character characteristics (functions in `<cctype>` header).
- **C++ Tip:** Use `#include <cctype>` instead of `#include <ctype.h>` for C library functions.
    - C++ versions (e.g., `<cctype>`) are in `std` namespace for consistency.

**Further details may be found in Table 3.3 (overleaf).**

## <font color="green0">Processing Every Character? Use Range-Based for</f>

**Key Points:**

- Use a range-based for loop to iterate through characters in a string.
- Syntax: `for (declaration : expression) statement`
    - `expression`: object representing a **sequence** (e.g., string).
    - `declaration`: variable to access elements in the sequence.
- Loop iterates, assigning each character in the string to the variable on each pass.

**Example 1: Printing Characters**

```cpp
string str = "some string";
for (auto c : str) { // for every char in str
  cout << c << endl;  // print character followed by newline
}
```

**Example 2: Counting Punctuation**

```cpp
string s = "Hello World!!!";
decltype(s.size()) punct_cnt = 0;  // counter for punctuation characters
for (auto c : s) {
  if (ispunct(c)) {  // check if character is punctuation
    ++punct_cnt;    // increment counter
  }
}
cout << punct_cnt << " punctuation characters in " << s << endl;
```

**Additional Notes:**

- `auto` lets the compiler determine the variable type (usually `char` for characters).
- `ispunct` function checks if a character is punctuation.

**Table 3.3: cctype Functions:**

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|isalnum(c)|true if c is a letter or a digit.|
|isalpha(c)|true if c is a letter.|
|iscntrl(c)|true if c is a control character.|
|isdigit(c)|true if c is a digit.|
|isgraph(c)|true if c is not a space but is printable.|
|islower(c)|true if c is a lowercase letter.|
|isprint(c)|true if c is a printable character (space or visible representation).|
|ispunct(c)|true if c is a punctuation character (not control, digit, letter, or printable whitespace).|
|isspace(c)|true if c is whitespace (space, tab, vertical tab, return, newline, or formfeed).|
|isupper(c)|true if c is an uppercase letter.|
|isxdigit(c)|true if c is a hexadecimal digit.|
|tolower(c)|If c is uppercase, returns lowercase equivalent; otherwise returns c unchanged.|
|toupper(c)|If c is lowercase, returns uppercase equivalent; otherwise returns c unchanged.|

**Further Exploration:**

The `<cctype>` header provides additional functions for character classification. You can use these functions within your range-based for loops to manipulate or analyze text data based on character types.

### <font color="pink">Using a Range for to Change the Characters in a string</f>

**Key Point:**

- To modify characters in a string using a range-based for loop, declare the loop variable as a reference.

**Explanation:**

A regular loop variable holds a copy of the element, but a reference provides a direct alias to the element itself. This allows you to modify the original string during the loop iteration.

**Example: Converting to Uppercase**

```cpp
string s = "Hello World!!!";

// convert s to uppercase
for (auto &c : s) {  // for every char in s (note: c is a reference)
  c = toupper(c);    // c is a reference, so assignment changes char in s
}

cout << s << endl;  // Output: HELLO WORLD!!!
```

**Breakdown:**

1. `auto &c : s`: Declares `c` as a reference to each character in `s`.
2. `c = toupper(c)`: Calls `toupper` on the current character (`c`) and assigns the uppercase version back to `c`, effectively modifying the character in-place within `s`.

**Additional Notes:**

- This approach is more efficient than creating a new string with the modifications.
- Explore other character manipulation functions like `tolower` or custom logic within the loop.

## <font color="green0">Processing Only Some Characters?</f>

**Beyond Range-Based for Loops:**

While range-based for loops are great for iterating through all characters, specific situations require different approaches.

**Scenarios:**

- Accessing a single character (e.g., capitalizing the first letter).
- Processing characters until a condition is met (e.g., reading until a space).

**Methods:**

1. Subscript Operator (`[]`):
    
    - Accesses a character at a specific position (index).
    - Index starts from 0 (first character).
    - Valid index range: 0 to `s.size() - 1` (avoid empty strings).
    - Example: `s[0]` refers to the first character in `s`.
2. Iterators (covered later):
    
    - Provide more control over character access and manipulation.

**Using Subscript Operator:**

```cpp
string s = "some string";

// Check for empty string before accessing characters
if (!s.empty()) {
  cout << s[0] << endl; // Print the first character
}

// Capitalize the first letter (assuming non-const string)
s[0] = toupper(s[0]); // Modify the character at index 0
```

**Important Notes:**

- Subscripting an empty string or using an invalid index leads to <font color="red">undefined behavior</font>.
- Subscript value can be any expression that evaluates to an integer.
- <font color="red">Signed subscript values are converted to the unsigned type `string::size_type`</font>.

### <font color="pink">Using a Subscript for Iteration</f>

**Iterating over Characters with Subscripts**

This example capitalizes the first word in a string:

```cpp
for (decltype(s.size()) index = 0;
     index != s.size() && !isspace(s[index]); ++index) {
  s[index] = toupper(s[index]); // capitalize current character
}
```

- We use a `for` loop with an index (`index`) to iterate through characters.
- `decltype(s.size())` ensures `index` has the correct type for string size.

**Loop Breakdown:**

- `index` starts at 0 to access the first character.
- Loop continues as long as `index` is within string bounds (`index != s.size()`) and the current character is not whitespace (`!isspace(s[index])`).
- Inside the loop, the current character is capitalized using `toupper`.

**Logical AND (`&&`) for Safety**

- The loop condition uses the logical AND operator (`&&`).
    - It guarantees the right operand (`!isspace(s[index])`) is only evaluated if the left operand (`index != s.size()`) is true.
    - <font color="red">This ensures we only access characters within the string bounds</font>.

**Caution: Unchecked Subscripts**

- Subscripts are NOT guaranteed to be checked by the library.
- It's YOUR responsibility to ensure `index` is within range (0 to `s.size()`-1).
- <font color="red">Using `decltype(s.size())` for `index` helps prevent negative subscripts</font>.
- Always check if `index` is less than the string size (`index < s.size()`) before using it as a subscript.

### <font color="pink">Using a Subscript for Random Access</f>

## Random Access with Subscripts in Strings

**Beyond Sequential Processing:**

This builds upon the concept of using subscripts with strings. Unlike the previous example that iterated character-by-character, here we directly access specific characters using calculated subscripts.

**Example: Hexadecimal Representation**

We can create a program that converts numbers (0-15) to their hexadecimal representation using string subscripts. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialize a String:** We create a constant string `hexdigits` containing all hexadecimal digits (0-F):
    
    
    ```cpp
    const string hexdigits = "0123456789ABCDEF"; // possible hex digits
    ```
    
    We make `hexdigits` constant (`const`) to ensure these values remain unchanged throughout the program.
    
2. **User Input and Conversion:** The program prompts the user to enter a series of numbers separated by spaces. It then reads each number (`n`) and performs the following:
    
    - **Validity Check:** We verify if `n` is within the valid range (less than the size of `hexdigits`). This ensures we don't access characters outside the string's boundaries.
    - **Subscript Access:** If `n` is valid, we use it as a subscript to access the corresponding hex digit in `hexdigits`. For example, if `n` is 12, `hexdigits[n]` will be 'C' (the 13th character, zero-indexed).
    - **Result Construction:** We append the retrieved hex digit to a result string (`result`).
3. **Output:** Once all user input is processed, the program prints the final hex number stored in the `result` string.
    

**Example Code (Simplified):**

```cpp
string result; // will hold the resulting hexify'd string

while (cin >> n) {
  if (n < hexdigits.size()) { // ignore invalid input
    result += hexdigits[n];   // fetch the indicated hex digit
  }
}

cout << "Your hex number is: " << result << endl;
```

**Key Points:**

- Subscripts allow direct access to any character position in a string.
- Validate subscript values to ensure they are within the string's size to avoid errors.
- `string::size_type` guarantees non-negative values, but it's good practice to double-check.

**Example Output:**

Input: `12 0 5 15 8 15`

Output: `Your hex number is: C05F8F`

**Further Considerations:**

- Remember that string indices start from 0 (unlike some languages).
- Be cautious when dealing with user input and handle potential invalid values.
