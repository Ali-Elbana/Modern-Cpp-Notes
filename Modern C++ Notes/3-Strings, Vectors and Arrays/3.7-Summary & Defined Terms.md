**Fundamental Data Structures:**

- **String:** A variable-length sequence of characters used to represent text.
- **Vector:** A container that holds a collection of objects of a single type, offering dynamic resizing and efficient element access.

**Iterators:**

- Objects that allow indirect access to elements within a container (string or vector).
- Used for traversing and navigating elements.

**Arrays vs. Standard Library Containers:**

- **Arrays:** Built-in language feature with fixed size at compile time.
- **Standard Library Containers (Vectors):** Offer dynamic resizing, bounds checking, and various member functions for element manipulation and iteration. Generally preferred for modern C++ development.

**Important Terms:**

- **begin()**: Returns an iterator pointing to the first element (string and vector).
- **end()**: Returns an off-the-end iterator (string and vector).
- **empty()**: Returns true if the container is empty, false otherwise (string and vector).
- **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the container (string and vector).
- **push_back()**: Appends an element to the back of a vector.
- **Null-terminated String**: A string with a null character (`\0`) at the end to indicate its termination.
- **Buffer Overflow**: A critical programming error when accessing an element outside the valid range of a container.
- **Class Template**: A blueprint for creating specific classes based on a specified element type (e.g., `vector<int>`).
- **Container**: A data structure that holds a collection of objects of a specific type.
- **Iterator Arithmetic**: Operations like addition/subtraction on iterators to move forward/backward.

**Other Important Concepts:**

- **Copy Initialization**: Initializes an object as a copy of another object using the `=` operator.
- **Direct Initialization**: Initializes an object without using an assignment operator (`=`).
- **Range-for loop**: A control flow statement that iterates over elements in a collection.
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: Arithmetic operations on pointers for memory manipulation.
- **Value Initialization**: Initializes objects with built-in values (zero for numeric types) or class default constructors.
- **Namespace**: A mechanism for organizing code and avoiding naming conflicts.
- **Operator Overloading**: Ability for user-defined types to define behavior for operators like `<<`, `>>`, etc.
