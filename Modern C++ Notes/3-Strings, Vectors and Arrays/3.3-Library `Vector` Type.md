## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

**What is a vector?**

- A vector is a container class that stores a collection of elements of the same type.
- Each element has an associated index for direct access.

**Using std::vector:**

- Include the `<vector>` header file.
- Use `using std::vector;` for convenience (optional).

**std::vector as a Class Template:**

- A template provides a blueprint for creating different classes.
- We don't need to understand template creation to use them (covered later).
- When using a template, we specify the desired element type for the container.

**Specifying Element Type:**

- `< >` brackets are used after the template name to define the element type.
    - `vector<int>`: Holds integers.
    - `vector<Sales_item>`: Holds objects of type `Sales_item`.
    - `vector<vector<string>>`: Holds vectors of strings (nested vectors).

**Key Points:**

- `vector` itself is a template, not a specific type.
- Valid element types include most built-in types, user-defined classes, <font color="red">but not references</font>.
- Vectors can hold elements that are themselves vectors (nested vectors).

**Historical Note:**

- Some older compilers might require a space between the closing angle bracket and the element type for nested vectors (e.g., `vector<vector<int> >`).

**Caution:**

- Be aware of potential compiler variations in syntax for nested vector declarations.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Defining and Initializing vectors:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

Vectors, like other class types in C++, have specific ways to be defined and initialized. Here's a summary:

**1. Default Initialization:**

```cpp
vector<string> svec;  // Creates an empty vector of strings (svec has no elements)
```

This is useful when you want to create a vector and populate it later in your program.

**2. Initialization with Values:**

You can provide initial values for the elements during vector definition:

- **Copying Elements from Another Vector:**

```cpp
vector<int> ivec;           // Initially empty vector of integers
vector<int> ivec2(ivec);   // Copy elements of ivec into ivec2 (both must be of the same type)
vector<int> ivec3 = ivec; // copy elements of ivec into ivec3
```

**Important Note:** Copying creates a new vector with independent elements (changes in one won't affect the other).

**Type Mismatch Errors:**

Attempting to copy elements from a vector of one type (e.g., strings) to a vector of another type (e.g., integers) will result in a compilation error.

## <font color="green0">List Initializing a vector</f>

**Efficient Element Initialization:**

C++ provides list initialization, a convenient way to create and initialize vectors with a list of elements enclosed in curly braces (`{}`).

**Example:**

```cpp
vector<string> articles = {"a", "an", "the"};
```

This code creates a vector named `articles` with three elements: "a", "an", and "the".

**Key Points:**

- List initialization offers a concise syntax for vector creation and element assignment.
- Elements within the curly braces are directly assigned to the vector's elements.
- List initialization is flexible, allowing zero or more elements.

**Comparison with Other Initialization Methods:**

- C++ offers various initialization methods (`=`, `{}` within class definition).
- List initialization is the only way to provide a list of initializers for vectors.
- Parentheses `()` cannot be used for list initialization (unlike some other cases).

**Example (Error):**

```cpp
vector<string> v2("a", "an", "the"); // Error: list initialization requires curly braces
```

**Example (Correct):**

```cpp
vector<string> v2{"a", "an", "the"}; // list initialization
```

**Further Exploration:**

List initialization can be applied to other containers like arrays and strings as well.

## <font color="green0">Creating a Specified Number of Elements</f>

**Predefined Size and Element Values:**

C++ allows initializing vectors with a specific number of elements and a default value for each element.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
vector<type> name(count, value);
```

- `type`: The data type of the elements in the vector (e.g., `int`, `string`).
- `name`: The name of the vector variable you're creating.
- `count`: An integer specifying the number of elements in the vector.
- `value`: The value to be assigned to each element in the vector.

**Examples:**

- `vector<int> ivec(10, -1);` // Creates a vector of 10 integers, each initialized to -1.
- `vector<string> svec(10, "hi!");` // Creates a vector of 10 strings, each containing the string "hi!".

**Key Points:**

- <font color="red">This method is useful when you know the desired size of the vector and want all elements to have the same initial value</font>.
- The `count` must be a non-negative integer.

**Example Usage:**

```cpp
// Initialize a vector to store exam scores (all -1 initially)
vector<int> examScores(20, -1);
```

## <font color="green0">Value Initialization</f>

**Creating Vectors with Default Values:**

C++ allows us to create vectors and specify their size without explicitly providing element values. In this case, the library uses <font color="red">value initialization</font> to fill the vector's elements.

**How Value Initialization Works:**

- The type of elements in the vector determines the value used for initialization.
    - Built-in types (e.g., `int`): Elements are initialized to 0.
    - Class types (e.g., `string`): Elements are default initialized (often empty or zero-valued).
- Examples:
    - `vector<int> ivec(10);` creates a vector with 10 elements, each initialized to 0.
    - `vector<string> svec(10);` creates a vector with 10 elements, each an empty string.

**<font color="red">Restrictions</font>:**

1. **Non-Default Initializable Types:** Some classes might require explicit initialization. You cannot use size-only initialization for such types.
2. **Direct Initialization Required:** When specifying only size (without an initial value), use direct initialization (`vector<int> vi(10);`). Assigning a value (e.g., `vector<int> vi = 10;`) is not allowed.

**Table 3.4: Vector Initialization Summary**

|Syntax|Description|
|---|---|
|`vector<T> v1`|Empty vector, elements of type T (default initialization).|
|`vector<T> v2(v1)`|Copy of elements from v1 into a new vector v2.|
|`vector<T> v2 = v1`|Equivalent to `v2(v1)`. Creates v2 as a copy of v1.|
|`vector<T> v3(n, val)`|Vector v3 with n elements, each initialized with the value `val`.|
|`vector<T> v4(n)`|Vector v4 with n elements, each a copy of a value-initialized object.|
|`vector<T> v5{a, b, c...}`|Vector v5 with elements initialized by the corresponding initializers (a, b, c...).|
|`vector<T> v5 = {a, b, c...}`|Equivalent to `v5{a, b, c...}`.|

## <font color="green0">List Initializer or Element Count?</f>

**Understanding Initialization with Curly Braces vs. Parentheses**

In C++, when initializing vectors with a single or two integer values, the interpretation depends on whether you use curly braces `{}` or parentheses `()`. This note clarifies the difference.

**Key Points:**

- **Parentheses `()`: Construction**
    - Values are used to construct the vector's size or size and element value.
    - `vector<int> v1(10);` - Creates a vector `v1` with 10 elements initialized to 0.
    - `vector<int> v3(10, 1);` - Creates a vector `v3` with 10 elements, all set to 1.
- **Curly Braces `{}`: List Initialization (Preferred)**
    - Values are interpreted as a list of element initializers (if possible).
    - `vector<int> v2{10};` - Creates a vector `v2` with one element, the value 10.
    - `vector<string> v5{"hi"};` - Creates a vector `v5` with one element, the string "hi".

**When List Initialization Doesn't Work:**

- If curly braces are used and the values cannot be directly assigned as elements (e.g., `int` for a `string` vector), <font color="red">construction happens</font>.
    - `vector<string> v7{10};` - Creates a vector `v7` with 10 default-initialized strings (empty).

**Additional Notes:**

- Parentheses are generally used for construction, while curly braces are preferred for list initialization (more readable and flexible).
- List initialization requires compatible element types within the braces.
- For strings, only curly braces can be used for list initialization (parentheses with strings result in errors).

**Example Summary:**

| Vector Initialization          | Code                           | Result                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Size (0-filled)                | `vector<int> v1(10);`          | `v1` has 10 elements with value 0               |
| Single Element                 | `vector<int> v2{10};`          | `v2` has one element with value 10              |
| Size and Element Value         | `vector<int> v3(10, 1);`       | `v3` has 10 elements, all set to 1              |
| Two Elements                   | `vector<int> v4{10, 1};`       | `v4` has two elements, values 10 and 1          |
| String Element (List Init)     | `vector<string> v5{"hi"};`     | `v5` has one element, the string "hi"           |
| Default-Initialized Strings    | `vector<string> v7{10};`       | `v7` has 10 default-initialized strings (empty) |
| Two-Element String (List Init) | `vector<string> v8{10, "hi"};` | `v8` has 10 elements, all set to "hi"           |

**Keep in mind:**

- <font color="red">If list initialization isnâ€™t possible, the compiler looks for other ways to initialize the object from the given values</font>.

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Beyond Direct Initialization:**

While direct initialization is useful for small, known element sets, creating and populating vectors often happens dynamically. This note explores using `push_back` to efficiently add elements at runtime.

**Key Points:**

- Direct initialization is suitable for:
    - A small number of known values.
    - Copying another vector.
    - Initializing all elements to the same value.
- For large numbers of elements or unknown values, consider an empty vector and `push_back`.
    - `push_back` efficiently adds elements to the vector's "back."

**Example: Creating a Vector from 0 to 99**

- Direct initialization for 0 to 9 is manageable, but for larger ranges:
    - `vector<int> v = {0, 1, ..., 99};` (tedious and error-prone)
- A better approach:
    - `vector<int> v;` (empty vector)
    - `for (int i = 0; i != 100; ++i) { v.push_back(i); }` (add elements in a loop)

**Unknown Number of Elements:**

- Similar approach works for unknown element count:
    - `vector<string> text;` (empty vector)
    - Read input values and use `text.push_back(word)` to add them.

**Efficiency of Vector Growth:**

- The C++ standard guarantees efficient vector growth when adding elements at runtime.
- <font color="red">Defining a vector with a specific size is often unnecessary (except for all-same values)</font>.
- Starting empty and adding elements is usually more efficient for varying values.

**Contrast with Built-in Arrays:**

- Unlike C/Java arrays, defining a vector at its expected size isn't always optimal.
- Vectors can grow dynamically, adapting to your program's needs.

## <font color="green0">Programming Implications of Adding Elements to a vector</f>

**Efficiency and Complexity:**

The ability to dynamically add elements to vectors offers significant advantages in many programming tasks. However, this flexibility comes with a responsibility to write loops that handle vector size changes correctly.

**Key Points:**

- Loops that modify a vector's size (adding elements) require careful design.
- <font color="red">Modifying the size during iteration within a range-based for loop can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. (We'll delve deeper later)</font>.

**Example (Incorrect):**

```cpp
// This loop attempts to add elements while iterating (wrong!)
for (int x : myVector) {
  myVector.push_back(x * 2); // Modifies vector size during iteration
}
```

**Alternative Approaches:**

- Consider iterating by index instead of using a range-based for loop when the loop body modifies the vector's size.
- Create a copy of the vector if you need to iterate over the original elements while adding new ones.

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>Other vector Operations:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Accessing Elements:**

- Similar to strings, elements are accessed by their position (`v[n]`).

**Iterating through elements:**

- Use a range-for loop:

```cpp
for (auto &i : v) {
  // process element i
}
```

**Common Operations (Table 3.5):**

|Operation|Description|
|---|---|
|`v.empty()`|Returns `true` if the vector is empty, `false` otherwise.|
|`v.size()`|Returns the number of elements in the vector.|
|`v.push_back(t)`|Adds an element with value `t` to the end of the vector.|
|`v[n]`|Returns a reference to the element at position `n` in the vector.|
|`v1 = v2`|Replaces elements in `v1` with a copy of elements in `v2`.|
|`v1 = {a, b, c, ...}`|Replaces elements in `v1` with a copy of elements in the list.|
|`v1 == v2`|Equality check: true if both vectors have the same number of elements with the same values (corresponding elements).|
|`v1 != v2`|Inequality check: opposite of `v1 == v2`.|
|`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`|Relational operators based on dictionary ordering (fewer elements < more elements, first differing element determines order).|

**Notes:**

- The first range-for loop iteration uses a reference (`&`) to modify elements in-place.
- `auto` deduces the element type in the loop.
- The compound assignment operator `*=` multiplies the left and right operands, storing the result in the left-hand operand.
- `vector<int>::size_type` specifies the size type for a vector of integers.
- Vectors of user-defined classes can only be compared if the class defines equality and relational operators.

## <font color="green0">Computing a vector Index</f>

**Key Points:**

- Vectors use subscript operator (`[]`) to access elements, similar to strings.
- Subscript starts at 0 and uses `size_type` for the index.
- We can compute an index and directly fetch the element at that position.

**Example: Counting Grades by Clusters**

- Grades range from 0 to 100, represented by 11 clusters (10 clusters of 10 + 1 for 100).
- We create a vector with 11 elements (counters) to hold the cluster counts.
- Cluster index for a grade is calculated by dividing the grade by 10 (truncating decimals).

**Code Example:**

```cpp
vector<unsigned> scores(11, 0); // 11 buckets, all initially 0
unsigned grade;
while (cin >> grade) {
  if (grade <= 100) { // handle only valid grades
    ++scores[grade / 10]; // increment counter for the current cluster
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We initialize the vector `scores` with 11 elements, all set to 0.
- We read grades in a loop.
- Inside the loop, we check for valid grades (less than or equal to 100).
- For valid grades, we increment the appropriate counter using `scores[grade / 10]`.
    - `grade / 10` calculates the cluster index.
    - We increment the counter at that index to record the grade occurrence.

**Important Note:**

- Always ensure your indices are within the valid range (0 to `scores.size() - 1`) to avoid accessing out-of-bounds elements.

## <font color="green0">Subscripting Does Not Add Elements</f>

## Subscripting in C++ Vectors: Don't Add, Just Access!

**Key Points:**

- Subscripting (`[]`) retrieves elements, it doesn't add them.
- Using subscript on an empty vector throws an error (no elements to access).
- The correct way to add elements is with `push_back()`.
- Subscript only elements that exist (avoid out-of-range access).
- Subscripting non-existent elements leads to undefined behavior (potential crashes, security issues).
- Use range-based for loops to iterate through vectors safely whenever possible (avoids subscripting).

**Examples:**

- **Wrong:** `vector<int> ivec; for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) ivec[i] = i;` (tries to add elements using subscript)
- **Right:** `vector<int> ivec; for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) ivec.push_back(i);` (adds elements using push_back)

**Remember:** Subscripting is for accessing, `push_back` is for adding!
