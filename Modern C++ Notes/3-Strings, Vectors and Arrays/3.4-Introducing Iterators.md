## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

- **Concept:** Iterators are a generalization of pointers for accessing elements in containers (like vectors) and strings.
- **Benefits:**
    - Work with various containers (not just arrays).
    - More general mechanism than subscripts (supported by fewer containers).
- **Availability:**
    - All standard library containers have iterators.
    - Strings are not containers but support iterators (and subscript operator).
- **Functionality:**
    - Indirect access to elements (similar to pointers).
    - Fetching elements.
    - Moving between elements within the container/string.
- **Validity:**
    - Valid iterator: points to an element or <font color="red">one past the last element</font>.
    - Invalid iterator: any other value.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Using Iterators:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Iterators vs. Pointers**

- Don't use address-of operator (&) to get iterators.
- Container types have member functions `begin()` and `end()` to return iterators.

**begin() and end()**

- `begin()` points to the first element (or character) in the container.
- `end()` points one past the last element (acts as a marker for the end).

**Off-the-End Iterator**

- The iterator returned by `end()` is called the off-the-end iterator.
- It signifies the end of the container and has no corresponding element.
- If the container is empty, `begin()` and `end()` return the same off-the-end iterator.

**Iterator Types**

- We generally don't need to know the specific iterator type.
- Using `auto` with `begin()` and `end()` lets the compiler deduce the type.

## <font color="green0">Iterator Operations</f>

**Summary:**

- Iterators have few key operations for navigating and manipulating elements in containers.
- Equality comparison (`==` and `!=`) checks if iterators point to the same element or are both "off-the-end" for the same container.
- Dereferencing (`*`) an iterator retrieves the element it points to (similar to pointers). However, dereferencing an invalid iterator leads to undefined behavior.
- Iterators can be incremented (`++`) and decremented (`--`) to move through the container.

**Example:** Capitalizing the first character of a string using an iterator.

```cpp
string s("some string");
if (s.begin() != s.end()) { // check if string is not empty
  auto it = s.begin();
  *it = toupper(*it); // make first character uppercase
}
```

**Table:** Standard Container Iterator Operations

|Operation|Description|
|---|---|
|`*iter`|Returns a reference to the element pointed to by the iterator.|
|`iter->mem`|Dereferences `iter` and accesses member `mem` of the underlying element (equivalent to `(*iter).mem`).|
|`++iter`|Increments `iter` to point to the next element.|
|`--iter`|Decrements `iter` to point to the previous element.|
|`iter1 == iter2`|Compares two iterators for equality.|
|`iter1 != iter2`|Compares two iterators for inequality.|
## <font color="green0">Moving Iterators from One Element to Another</f>

**Iterating through elements:**

- Use the increment (++) operator to move from one element to the next in a container.
- Similar to incrementing an integer, it advances the iterator by one position.
- **Caution:** Don't increment or dereference the iterator returned by `end()` as it doesn't point to an element.

**Example: Capitalizing the first word in a string using iterators**

```cpp
for (auto it = s.begin(); it != s.end() && !isspace(*it); ++it)
  *it = toupper(*it);
```

- `it` starts at `s.begin()`, pointing to the first character.
- The loop continues as long as `it` hasn't reached the end (`!= s.end()`) and the current character isn't whitespace (`!isspace(*it)`).
- Inside the loop:
    - `*it` dereferences the iterator to access the current character.
    - `toupper(*it)` converts the character to uppercase.
    - The result is assigned back to the character pointed to by `it`.
- `++it` advances the iterator to the next character.

**Key Concept: Generic Programming**

- C++ uses `!=` instead of `<` in `for` loops to iterate through containers.
- This approach, along with using iterators, allows code to work with various container types from the library.
- Not all containers support subscripting (like vectors and strings), but all have iterators with `==` and `!=` operators.
- By using iterators and `!=`, we write code independent of the specific container type.

## <font color="green0">Iterator Types</f>

**Summary:**

- Similar to `size_type`, iterators don't have a specific type you necessarily need to know.
- Containers define `iterator` and `const_iterator` types for read/write and read-only access, respectively.
- `const_iterator` behaves like a constant pointer (read-only).
- Use `const_iterator` for constant containers, otherwise either `iterator` or `const_iterator` works.

## <font color="green0">The begin and end Operations</f>

**Iterator Types and Constness:**

- `begin()` and `end()` functions return iterators for accessing elements in containers.
- The type of iterator returned depends on whether the object is `const` or not.
    - `const` object: `begin()` and `end()` return `const_iterator`. (Read-only access)
    - Non-const object: `begin()` and `end()` return `iterator`. (Read-write access)

**Example:**

```cpp
vector<int> v;
const vector<int> cv;

auto it1 = v.begin(); // it1: vector<int>::iterator (read-write)
auto it2 = cv.begin(); // it2: vector<int>::const_iterator (read-only)
```

**Using `const_iterator` (Recommended):**

- Often, we only need to read elements, not modify them.
- Using `const_iterator` explicitly improves code clarity and avoids potential issues.

**New Functions for Consistent `const_iterator`:**

- C++ introduced `cbegin()` and `cend()` functions.
- <font color="red">These functions always return `const_iterator`, regardless of the object's constness</font>.

**Example:**

```cpp
auto it3 = v.cbegin(); // it3: vector<int>::const_iterator (read-only)
```

**Key Point:**

- `cbegin()` and `cend()` are preferred for iterating through containers when you only need to read elements.

## <font color="green0">Combining Dereference and Member Access</f>

**Key Points:**

- Dereferencing an iterator with `*` retrieves the object it points to.
- Member access with `.` operates on objects, not iterators.
- Use parentheses `(*it).member` to ensure member access after dereferencing.
- Arrow operator `->` combines dereferencing and member access: `it->member` is equivalent to `(*it).member`.

**Example: Checking for Empty Strings in a Vector**

```cpp
vector<string> text; // Stores text data with empty strings for paragraph breaks
// ... (fill vector)

for (auto it = text.cbegin(); it != text.cend() && !it->empty(); ++it) {
  cout << *it << endl; // Print current element (sentence)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Loop iterates through `text` until an empty string (paragraph break) is found.
- `it->empty()` checks if the string pointed to by `it` is empty.
- `cbegin()` and `cend()` are used for read-only iteration.

**Parentheses are Important!**

- `(*it).empty()` - Correct: dereference `it` then access `empty` member.
- `*it.empty()` - Incorrect: tries to access `empty` member of iterator itself (which doesn't exist).

## <font color="green0">Some vector Operations Invalidate Iterators</f>

**Key points:**

- Vectors can grow dynamically, meaning they can increase in size as needed.
- This dynamic growth can invalidate iterators, which are pointers to elements within the vector.
- <font color="red">Avoid modifying the vector's size (adding or removing elements) inside a loop that iterates using iterators. This can lead to unexpected behavior</font>.

**Further details: Covered Later**

**In simpler terms:**

- Think of an iterator as a finger pointing to a specific element in the vector.
- If the vector grows or shrinks, the elements might shift around in memory.
- This can cause your finger (iterator) to be pointing to the wrong element, or even to invalid memory.

**To avoid issues:**

- If you need to modify the vector's size, do it before iterating using a loop.
- Consider using a different approach if you must modify the vector while iterating.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Iterator Arithmetic:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Basic Operations:**

- **Increment/Decrement:** `++iter` or `iter++` moves the iterator forward one element. `--iter` or `iter--` moves backward one element.
- **Comparison:** `iter1 == iter2` and `iter1 != iter2` are valid for iterators of the same container type.

**Vector and String Iterators:**

- **Addition/Subtraction:** `iter + n` moves the iterator `n` elements forward. `iter - n` moves `n` elements backward.
    - Resulting iterator must be within the container or point one element past the end.
- **Compound Assignment:** `iter1 += n` is equivalent to `iter1 = iter1 + n`. Similar for subtraction.
- **Iterator Difference:** `iter1 - iter2` gives the number of elements between `iter1` and `iter2` (when added to `iter2` results in `iter1`).
    - Iterators must be from the same container.
- **Relational Operators:** `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` compare the order of elements within the container.
    - Iterators must be from the same container.

**Key Points:**

- Not all iterators support full arithmetic (e.g., list iterators).
- Be cautious with `end()` iterator in calculations (points one element past the end).

**Table 3.7: Operations Supported by vector and string Iterators**

|Operation|Description|
|---|---|
|`iter + n`|Move iterator forward `n` elements.|
|`iter - n`|Move iterator backward `n` elements.|
|`iter1 += n`|Equivalent to `iter1 = iter1 + n`.|
|`iter1 -= n`|Equivalent to `iter1 = iter1 - n`.|
|`iter1 - iter2`|Get the number of elements between `iter1` and `iter2`.|
|`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`|Compare the order of elements within the container.|
## <font color="green0">Arithmetic Operations on Iterators</f>

**Adding/Subtracting with Iterators:**

- You can add or subtract an integer value (`n`) to/from an iterator (`iter`).
- This moves the iterator `n` elements forward (addition) or backward (subtraction).
- The resulting iterator must point to an element within the container or one element past the end.

**Example: Finding the Middle Element (Approximately):**

```cpp
// vi is a vector
auto mid = vi.begin() + vi.size() / 2;
```

This code calculates an iterator (`mid`) pointing to the element closest to the middle of the vector `vi`. Here's how it works:

1. `vi.size()` gives the number of elements in `vi`.
2. Dividing by 2 approximates the middle index (integer division truncates).
3. Adding this value to `vi.begin()` moves the iterator `mid` forward that many positions.

**Relational Operators on Iterators:**

- You can compare iterators from the same vector/string using relational operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`).
- Iterators must be valid and point to elements within the container or one element past the end.

**Example: Checking Element Position:**

```cpp
if (it < mid) // process elements in the first half of vi
```

This code checks if iterator `it` (assumed to be from the same vector as `mid`) points to an element before `mid` in the vector `vi`.

**Subtracting Iterators:**

- You can subtract two iterators from the same vector/string.
- The result (`difference_type`) represents the distance between the iterators (how many elements you need to move from one to reach the other).
- <font color="red">`difference_type` is a signed integral type to handle negative distances</font>.

**Key Points:**

- Not all iterators support full arithmetic (e.g., list iterators).
- Be cautious with `end()` iterator in calculations (points one element past the end).

## <font color="green0">Binary Search with Iterators</f>

**Complete Example (using a vector of strings):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool binary_search(const vector<string>& text, const string& sought) {
  // Ensure the text is sorted (not shown here, assume it's sorted)

  // Initialize iterators
  auto beg = text.begin();
  auto end = text.end();

  while (beg != end && *beg != sought) {
    // Calculate midpoint
    auto mid = beg + (end - beg) / 2;

    // Check if target is in the first half
    if (sought < *mid) {
      end = mid; // Ignore second half
    } else {
      beg = mid + 1; // Ignore first half and mid
    }
  }

  // Check if target found
  return beg != end; // True if mid points to the target (beg == end)
}

int main() {
  vector<string> names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"};

  string target = "Charlie";
  bool found = binary_search(names, target);

  if (found) {
    cout << target << " was found in the list." << endl;
  } else {
    cout << target << " was not found in the list." << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This example defines a `binary_search` function that takes a sorted vector of strings and a target string. It uses iterators to perform the binary search and returns true if the target is found, false otherwise. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `binary_search` function to search for a name in a list.

**Concept:**

- A binary search efficiently finds a specific value in a sorted sequence.
- It repeatedly divides the search area in half until the target value is found or eliminated.

**Implementation with Iterators:**

1. **Initialization:**
    
    - `beg`: Iterator pointing to the first element in the search range.
    - `end`: Iterator pointing one element past the last element in the range.
    - `mid`: Iterator pointing to the element closest to the middle of the range (initially `(end - beg) / 2` elements away from `beg`).
2. **Search Loop:**
    
    - Continues as long as there are elements to search (`mid != end`) and the target value hasn't been found (`*mid != sought`).
    - If the target value is less than the current middle element (`sought < *mid`), the target must be in the first half of the remaining range. Update `end` to point to the current `mid` (effectively ignoring the second half).
    - If the target value is greater than the current middle element (`sought > *mid`), the target must be in the second half of the remaining range. Update `beg` to point to the element just after `mid` (effectively ignoring `mid` and the first half).
    - In each iteration, a new midpoint is calculated based on the updated `beg` and `end`.
3. **Outcome:**
    
    - If the loop exits because `mid == end`, the target value was not found in the sequence.
    - If the loop exits because `*mid == sought`, the target value was found and `mid` points to it.

**Key Points:**

- This approach relies on iterator arithmetic for efficient range manipulation.
- Requires the data to be sorted beforehand.

**Benefits:**

- Significantly faster than a linear search for large sorted datasets.
