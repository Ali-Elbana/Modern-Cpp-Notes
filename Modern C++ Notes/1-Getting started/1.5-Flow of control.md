Statements normally execute sequentially: The first statement in a block is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. Instead, programming languages provide various flow-of-control statements that allow for more complicated execution paths.

**Purpose:**

- Repeatedly executes a code block as long as a given condition remains true.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() 
{

    int sum = 0, val = 1;

    // Condition: val <= 10
    while( val <= 10 ) 
    {
        sum += val ;  // Add val to sum
        ++val ;       // Increment val by 1
    }

    std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is " << sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The output of this program is:

```txt
Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is 55
```

**What is a while loop?**

A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It works like this:

1. **Test the condition:** The loop first evaluates the condition specified in parentheses after `while`.
2. **Execute the code:** If the condition is true, the code block within the curly braces (`{}`) is executed.
3. **Repeat:** After executing the code block, the condition is evaluated again.
4. **Continue looping:** If the condition remains true, steps 2 and 3 repeat.
5. **Exit the loop:** When the condition becomes false, the loop terminates and the program continues to the code following the `while` loop.

**Example Breakdown:**

```cpp
// keep executing the while as long as val is less than or equal to 10
while (val <= 10) {
  sum += val; // assigns sum + val to sum
  ++val;       // add 1 to val
}
```

- **Condition:** `val <= 10` - This checks if the value of `val` is less than or equal to 10.
- **Body:** The code block within the curly braces (`{}`).
    - `sum += val;` - This adds the current value of `val` to the variable `sum` using the compound assignment operator `+=`.
    - `++val;` - This increments the value of `val` by 1 using the prefix increment operator `++`.
- **Looping:** The loop continues as long as `val` is less than or equal to 10.
- **Exit:** Once `val` becomes greater than 10, the loop exits.

**Key Points:**

- The condition must be an expression that evaluates to true or false.
- The code block can contain multiple statements.
- The loop continues executing the code block as long as the condition is true.
- Understanding while loops is essential for writing repetitive tasks in C++.

**Common Uses:**

- Summing a series of numbers.
- Reading input until a specific value is encountered.
- Implementing game loops.
- Processing data until a file ends.

**From While Loops to for Loops:**

Our previous `while` loop used a variable (`val`) to control iterations. This pattern (checking a condition on `val` and incrementing it within the loop) is common enough that C++ offers a shortcut: the `for` loop.

**for Loop Breakdown:**

```cpp
for (int val = 1; val <= 10; ++val) {
  sum += val; // equivalent to sum = sum + val
}
```

- **Header:** This controls loop execution and consists of three parts separated by semicolons:
    - **Initialization:** `int val = 1;` - Creates and initializes `val` to 1 (exists only inside the loop).
    - **Condition:** `val <= 10;` - Checked before each iteration. Loop continues if `val` is less than or equal to 10.
    - **Expression:** `++val;` - Executed after each iteration, incrementing `val` by 1.
- **Body:** The code block (`sum += val`) executes as long as the condition is true.

**Overall Flow:**

1. Create and initialize `val`.
2. Check condition. If true, execute the body and increment `val`.
3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the condition becomes false (i.e., `val` is greater than 10).

**Benefits of for Loops:**

- **Conciseness:** `for` loops provide a more compact way to write repetitive code compared to `while` loops for specific patterns.
- **Readability:** The structure clarifies the initialization, condition, and increment, making the loop's purpose easier to understand.

**Key Points:**

- `for` loops offer a concise way to iterate based on a condition and variable update.
- The header controls loop execution with initialization, condition, and expression.
- `for` loops are useful for common iteration patterns like counting or processing a range of values.
