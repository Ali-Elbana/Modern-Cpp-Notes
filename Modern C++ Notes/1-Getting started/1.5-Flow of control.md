Statements normally execute sequentially: The first statement in a block is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. Instead, programming languages provide various flow-of-control statements that allow for more complicated execution paths.

## <font color="yellow"><u>The while statement:</u></f>

**Purpose:**

- Repeatedly executes a code block as long as a given condition remains true.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() 
{

    int sum = 0, val = 1;

    // Condition: val <= 10
    while( val <= 10 ) 
    {
        sum += val ;  // Add val to sum
        ++val ;       // Increment val by 1
    }

    std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is " << sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The output of this program is:

```txt
Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is 55
```

**What is a while loop?**

A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It works like this:

1. **Test the condition:** The loop first evaluates the condition specified in parentheses after `while`.
2. **Execute the code:** If the condition is true, the code block within the curly braces (`{}`) is executed.
3. **Repeat:** After executing the code block, the condition is evaluated again.
4. **Continue looping:** If the condition remains true, steps 2 and 3 repeat.
5. **Exit the loop:** When the condition becomes false, the loop terminates and the program continues to the code following the `while` loop.

**Example Breakdown:**

```cpp
// keep executing the while as long as val is less than or equal to 10
while (val <= 10) {
  sum += val; // assigns sum + val to sum
  ++val;       // add 1 to val
}
```

- **Condition:** `val <= 10` - This checks if the value of `val` is less than or equal to 10.
- **Body:** The code block within the curly braces (`{}`).
    - `sum += val;` - This adds the current value of `val` to the variable `sum` using the compound assignment operator `+=`.
    - `++val;` - This increments the value of `val` by 1 using the prefix increment operator `++`.
- **Looping:** The loop continues as long as `val` is less than or equal to 10.
- **Exit:** Once `val` becomes greater than 10, the loop exits.

**Key Points:**

- The condition must be an expression that evaluates to true or false.
- The code block can contain multiple statements.
- The loop continues executing the code block as long as the condition is true.
- Understanding while loops is essential for writing repetitive tasks in C++.

**Common Uses:**

- Summing a series of numbers.
- Reading input until a specific value is encountered.
- Implementing game loops.
- Processing data until a file ends.

**From While Loops to for Loops:**

Our previous `while` loop used a variable (`val`) to control iterations. This pattern (checking a condition on `val` and incrementing it within the loop) is common enough that C++ offers a shortcut: the `for` loop.

**for Loop Breakdown:**

```cpp
for (int val = 1; val <= 10; ++val) {
  sum += val; // equivalent to sum = sum + val
}
```

- **Header:** This controls loop execution and consists of three parts separated by semicolons:
    - **Initialization:** `int val = 1;` - Creates and initializes `val` to 1 (exists only inside the loop).
    - **Condition:** `val <= 10;` - Checked before each iteration. Loop continues if `val` is less than or equal to 10.
    - **Expression:** `++val;` - Executed after each iteration, incrementing `val` by 1.
- **Body:** The code block (`sum += val`) executes as long as the condition is true.

**Overall Flow:**

1. Create and initialize `val`.
2. Check condition. If true, execute the body and increment `val`.
3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the condition becomes false (i.e., `val` is greater than 10).

**Benefits of for Loops:**

- **Conciseness:** `for` loops provide a more compact way to write repetitive code compared to `while` loops for specific patterns.
- **Readability:** The structure clarifies the initialization, condition, and increment, making the loop's purpose easier to understand.

**Key Points:**

- `for` loops offer a concise way to iterate based on a condition and variable update.
- The header controls loop execution with initialization, condition, and expression.
- `for` loops are useful for common iteration patterns like counting or processing a range of values.

## <font color="yellow"><u>The if statement:</u></f>

Like most languages, C++ provides an if statement that supports conditional execution.
We can use an if to write a program to count how many consecutive times each distinct value appears in the input:

**Concepts:**

- **Conditional Execution:** C++'s `if` statement controls program flow based on conditions.
- **Input/Output Streams:** `std::cin` and `std::cout` handle user input and output, respectively.
- **Loops:** `while` loops repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- **Equality Operator:** `==` checks if two values are equal.
- **Assignment Operator:** `=` assigns a value to a variable.

**Code Breakdown:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Variables
  int currVal = 0, val = 0;
  int cnt = 1;  // Count for current value

  // Read first number
  if (std::cin >> currVal) {
    while (std::cin >> val) {
      // Same value, increment count
      if (val == currVal) {
        ++cnt;
      } else {
        // Different value, print previous count and reset
        std::cout << currVal << " occurs " << cnt << " times" << std::endl;
        currVal = val;
        cnt = 1;
      }
    }
    // Print count for last value
    std::cout << currVal << " occurs " << cnt << " times" << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `currVal` stores the current value being counted, `val` holds the next input value, and `cnt` tracks the consecutive occurrences.
2. **Read First Number:** Ensures there's input to process.
3. **Looping Through Input:** `while` loop reads numbers until the end of input.
4. **Checking for Consecutive Values:** `if` statement checks if the current `val` equals `currVal`.
    - **Same Value:** Increment `cnt` to count another occurrence.
    - **Different Value:** Print the previous value's count and reset for the new value.
5. **Printing Last Value Count:** After the loop, the final `currVal`'s count is printed.

**Common Mistake:** Using `=` for equality comparison within a condition should be `==`.

**Example Input/Output:**

```
Input: 42 42 42 42 42 55 55 62 100 100 100
Output: 42 occurs 5 times
        55 occurs 2 times
        62 occurs 1 times
        100 occurs 3 times
```
