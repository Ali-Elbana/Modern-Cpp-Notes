```cpp

// This line tells the compiler to include a header file named "iostream".
// This header file provides functions for input and output operations,
// like cout that we will use to print something on the screen.

#include <iostream>

// This line tells the compiler to use the "std" namespace.
// The std namespace contains commonly used objects and functions from the 
// iostream library (and many others). Using namespace std; avoids having
// to write std:: before every standard library item we use.
using namespace std;

// This line is the main function where the program execution begins.
// int main(void) indicates that the main function returns an integer value (int).
// void means it doesn't take any arguments. 
int main(void) 
{

  // This line uses the cout object from the iostream library 
  // to print the message "Lettttttssssssssss go" to the console (screen).
  // << is the insertion operator that sends data to the output stream.
  cout << "Lettttttssssssssss go" ;

  // This line marks the end of the main function. 
  // The program execution ends here. 
  return 0 ;
  
}
