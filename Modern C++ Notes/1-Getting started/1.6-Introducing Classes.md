## <font color="yellow"><u>Understanding Classes in C++:</u></f>

**What are Classes?**

- Classes are a fundamental concept in C++.
- They define a new data type along with the operations (functions) that can be performed on that data type.

**Importance of Classes:**

- Classes are one of the most important features of C++.
- They offer a way to create custom data types that behave similarly to built-in types (like integer or string).

**Using a Class:**

To use a class effectively, you need to know three things:

1. **Class Name:** The name given to the class (e.g., Sales_item).
2. **Definition Location:** Where the class is defined (typically in a header file).
3. **Supported Operations:** The functions (methods) that can be used on objects of that class.

**Header Files:**

- Similar to including library headers, we include a header file to access custom-defined classes.
- The header file name usually follows the class name with a `.h` suffix (e.g., Sales_item.h).

**Header File Naming Conventions:**

- While compilers are generally flexible with header file names, IDEs might have specific expectations.
    - Common suffixes include `.h`, `.H`, `.hpp`, or `.hxx`.
    - Standard library headers typically don't have a suffix.

**Benefits of Classes:**

- Classes promote code organization and reusability.
- They allow you to create complex data structures by combining simpler data types.

**What is the Sales_item class?**

The `Sales_item` class represents information about a book, including:

- Total revenue generated from sales
- Number of copies sold
- Average sales price (calculated later)

**Important Points:**

- We don't need to know how this data is stored or calculated internally.
- We focus on the operations (`isbn`, input/output, assignment, addition) that can be performed on `Sales_item` objects.

**Creating and Using Sales_item Objects:**

1. **Defining a variable:** `Sales_item item;`
    
    - This declares a variable named `item` of type `Sales_item`.
2. **Available Operations:**
    
    - `isbn()` function: Retrieves the ISBN number from a `Sales_item` object.
    - Input/output operators:
        - `cin >> item`: Reads data from standard input into an `item` object.
        - `cout << item`: Writes data from an `item` object to standard output.
    - Assignment operator (`=`): Copies data from one `Sales_item` object to another.
    - Addition operator (`+`): Adds two `Sales_item` objects (same ISBN required). The result is a new object with combined sales data.
    - Compound assignment operator (`+=`): Adds data from one `Sales_item` object to another (existing object is updated).

**Key Takeaways:**

- The `Sales_item` class provides a structured way to represent book sales data.
- We interact with `Sales_item` objects through defined operations, not internal implementation details.

**Using the Sales_item Class:**

This section explores how to use the `Sales_item` class we created earlier.

**Basic Reading and Writing:**

- The provided program demonstrates reading data (ISBN, copies sold, price) from standard input (`cin`) and storing it in a `Sales_item` object.
- It then writes the stored data back to standard output (`cout`).

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Sales_item.h"

int main() {
  Sales_item book;
  std::cin >> book;  // Read data into book object
  std::cout << book << std::endl;  // Write book object data
  return 0;
}
```

**Adding Sales_Items:**

- This example showcases adding two `Sales_item` objects.
- It reads data for two transactions into separate objects and then adds them using the overloaded `+` operator.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Sales_item.h"

int main() {
  Sales_item item1, item2;
  std::cin >> item1 >> item2;  // Read data for two transactions
  std::cout << item1 + item2 << std::endl;  // Print the sum of items
  return 0;
}
```

**Key Points:**

- The `#include` directive specifies header files. Angle brackets (`< >`) are used for standard library headers, while double quotes (`" "`) are used for custom headers.
- The `Sales_item` class allows us to define objects that hold sales data and perform operations like addition.
- Adding `Sales_item` objects refers to combining their corresponding data (ISBN, total copies sold, total revenue).

**Note:**

The concept of "sum" differs between integers and `Sales_item` objects. Adding integers gives the conventional sum, while adding `Sales_item` objects combines their sales data.

**Adding Sales Items with ISBN Check:**

This code demonstrates adding two `Sales_item` objects but first checks if they have the same ISBN:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Sales_item.h"

int main() {
  Sales_item item1, item2;
  std::cin >> item1 >> item2;

  // Check if ISBNs match before adding
  if (item1.isbn() == item2.isbn()) {
    std::cout << item1 + item2 << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cerr << "Data must refer to same ISBN" << std::endl;
    return -1; // Error
  }

  return 0; // Success
}
```

**Understanding the `if` Statement:**

Even without understanding the specific condition (`item1.isbn() == item2.isbn()`), we can grasp the program's logic:

- If the condition is true (ISBNs match), the sum is printed.
- If the condition is false (ISBNs differ), an error message is displayed.

**Member Functions Explained:**

The `isbn()` function used in the condition is a member function of the `Sales_item` class. Here's what that means:

- A member function is a function defined within a class and operates on objects of that class.
- It's often called using the dot operator (`.`) followed by the object name and the function name.
- In this case, `item1.isbn()` retrieves the ISBN stored in the `item1` object.

**Breakdown of `item1.isbn()`:**

- `item1`: The object we're working with.
- `.`: The dot operator, used to access members of an object.
- `isbn()`: The member function we want to call (no arguments in this case).

**Calling Member Functions:**

- Member functions are typically called using the call operator `()`.
- `item1.isbn()` calls the `isbn()` function on the `item1` object, returning the stored ISBN.

**The `if` Condition:**

- The `if` statement compares the ISBNs retrieved using `item1.isbn()` and `item2.isbn()`.
- If they match, the program proceeds with addition.

**In Summary:**

Member functions allow us to interact with objects by calling functions specific to their class. This allows for clean and organized code design.
