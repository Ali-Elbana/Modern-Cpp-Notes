## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

- C++ doesn't have built-in IO statements.
- The standard library provides IO functionalities through the `iostream` library.
- Key concepts:
    - `istream`: Represents input stream (e.g., reading from keyboard).
    - `ostream`: Represents output stream (e.g., printing to console).
- Streams are sequences of characters for reading from or writing to devices.
- Characters are processed sequentially in streams.

## <font color=yellow><u>C++ Standard IO Objects:</u></f>

- **Input:** `cin` (istream object) - represents standard input (usually keyboard).
- **Output:**
    - `cout` (ostream object) - represents standard output (usually console window).
    - `cerr` (ostream object) - represents standard error stream for warnings/errors.
    - `clog` (ostream object) - represents standard logging stream for general program information.
- By default, all these objects are associated with the program's execution window.
    - Reading from `cin` reads from the window.
    - Writing to `cout`, `cerr`, or `clog` writes to the same window.

**Example: Adding Two Numbers**

This code demonstrates using `iostream` for user input and output:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Prompt user for input
  std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl;

  // Declare variables for numbers
  int v1 = 0, v2 = 0;

  // Read user input into variables
  std::cin >> v1 >> v2;

  // Calculate and display the sum
  std::cout << "The sum of " << v1 << " and " << v2 << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **#include <iostream\>**: Includes the iostream library for IO operations.
2. **std::cout**: Used for output to the console (standard output).
    - `std::endl` adds a newline character after the message.
3. **std::cin**: Used for input from the console (standard input).
    - The user enters two numbers separated by a space.
4. **Variables**: `v1` and `v2` store the entered numbers.
5. **Calculation**: `v1 + v2` calculates the sum.
6. **Output**: Displays the sum with labels for clarity.

**Key Points:**
- Include the `<iostream>` header for IO operations.
- `std::cout` is used for printing to the console.
- `std::cin` is used for reading input from the console.
- Use `std::endl` for a newline after output.

## <font color=yellow><u>Writing to a Stream:</u></f>

The first statement in the body of main executes an expression. In C++ an #expression *yields a result and is composed of one or more operands and (usually) an operator*.

- **Output Operator (`<<`)**: Used to write data to a stream.
    - Left operand: `ostream` object (e.g., `cout`).
    - Right operand: Value to be printed.
    - Returns the left operand (the `ostream` object).
- **Chaining `<<`**: Multiple writes can be chained together using the return value of the operator.
- **Example:**
    
    ```cpp
    std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl;
    ```

    - Equivalent to separate `<<` statements:
        
        ```cpp
        std::cout << "Enter two numbers:";
        std::cout << std::endl;
        ```
    
- **String Literals**: Sequence of characters in double quotes ("") printed to the stream.
- **Manipulators**: Special values like `std::endl` that modify output behavior.
    - `std::endl` ends the current line and ***flushes*** the output buffer.

**Benefits of Chaining `<<`:**
- More concise code for multiple outputs.
- Easier to read when multiple outputs are related (e.g., printing a label and its value).

>**Warning:**  Programmers often add print statements during debugging. Such statements           
	should always flush the stream. Otherwise, if the program crashes,
	output may be left in the buffer, leading to incorrect inferences about
	where the program crashed.

## <font color=yellow><u>Namespaces from the Standard Library:</u></f>

- `std::cout`, `std::endl`: Full names indicate elements belong to the `std` namespace.
- Namespaces prevent naming conflicts between user-defined names and library names.
- Standard library elements reside in the `std` namespace.
- To use a library element, you need to specify `std::` prefix or use `using namespace std;` (with caution).
- `std::cout` uses the scope operator (`::`) to access `cout` from `std`.

## <font color=yellow><u>Reading from a Stream Notes:</u></f>

- **Reading User Input:**
    1. Declare variables to store the input (e.g., `int v1 = 0, v2 = 0;`).
    2. Use `std::cin >> var1 >> var2;` to read input.
        - `>>` is the input operator (similar to output operator `<<`).
        - Reads from `std::cin` (standard input) and stores in variables.
- **Input Operator Behavior:**
    - Takes `istream` as left operand and variable as right operand.
    - Reads data from `istream` and stores it in the variable.
    - Returns the `istream` object itself (allowing chaining multiple reads).
- **Example Breakdown:**
    - `std::cin >> v1 >> v2;` is equivalent to:
        
        ```cpp
        std::cin >> v1;
        std::cin >> v2;
        ```
        
    - Reads two values, storing the first in `v1` and the second in `v2`.
