## <font color="yellow"><u>Introduction:</u></f>

C++, similar to many other languages, offers various statements to manage program flow. These statements go beyond simple sequential execution and enable you to create more complex functionalities.

- **Sequential Execution:** By default, statements are executed one after another in the order they appear in the code. This works well for basic programs, but it becomes limiting for complex scenarios.
    
- **Flow Control Statements:** C++ provides a rich set of flow control statements that allow you to:
    
    - **Make Decisions:** Execute code conditionally based on specific conditions using statements like `if` and `switch`.
    - **Repeat Code Blocks:** Utilize loops like `while`, `do-while`, and `for` to execute a set of statements repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
    - **Alter Execution Flow:** Employ statements like `break` and `continue` to modify the normal execution order within loops or switch statements.

This chapter note deeper into the various statements C++ offers to empower you with precise control over your program's execution flow.

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**What are statements?**

C++ programs are built from individual instructions called statements. These statements tell the computer what actions to perform.

**Semicolons: The End Markers**

Most C++ statements conclude with a semicolon (;). This semicolon acts as a signal to the compiler, indicating the end of the instruction.

**Expression Statements: Evaluating and Discarding**

- An expression, like `ival + 5`, becomes an expression statement when followed by a semicolon.
    
- These statements evaluate the expression but discard the result.
    
    - Example (discarded result): `ival + 5;`

**Useful Expression Statements: Side Effects Matter**

Expression statements become valuable when the expression has a side effect. These side effects can include:

- Assigning a new value to a variable (e.g., `ival = ival + 5;`)
- Printing a result to the console (e.g., `cout << ival;`)

**Focus on Side Effects**

The key takeaway is to focus on the side effects of expressions in expression statements. They perform actions that modify program state (variable values) or interact with the outside world (like printing).

## <font color="green0">Null Statements</f>

**What are they?**

- The simplest statement in C++.
- Represented by a single semicolon `;`.

**What do they do?**

- Do nothing! They are placeholders when the program logic doesn't require an action.

**When to use them?**

- Often in loops where the work is done within the condition itself.
    - Example: Reading input until a specific value is found.

**Example:**

```cpp
while (cin >> s && s != sought) ; // null statement
```

- This loop:
    - Reads a value from standard input (`cin >> s`).
    - Checks if the read was successful (`cin`).
    - If successful, compares the read value (`s`) to the desired value (`sought`).
    - If not found, repeats the loop (null statement does nothing).

**Best Practices:**

- Comment null statements to clarify the intentional omission of an action.

## <font color="green0">Beware of Missing or Extraneous Semicolons</f>

**Beware the Missing or Extra Semicolon!**

- A null statement (just a semicolon) is legal anywhere a statement is expected. This can lead to unexpected behavior with semicolons.
- **Extra Semicolon Trap:**
    - An extra semicolon after a condition in a `while` or `if` statement can completely change the program's flow.
    - Example: `while (iter != svec.end());` - This looks like the loop body is indented code, but it's actually an empty loop due to the semicolon after the condition.
    - The intended increment (`++iter;`) is outside the loop and won't execute repeatedly.
- **Not Always Harmless:** Extra semicolons can cause unintended consequences, so be mindful of semicolon placement.

**Takeaway:** Double-check semicolon placement, especially after conditions in loops and `if` statements, to avoid unexpected null statements.

## <font color="green0">Compound Statements (Blocks)</f>

**What are they?**

- A block (or compound statement) is a group of zero or more statements and declarations enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- It creates a new scope for variables, meaning variables defined inside a block are only accessible within that block and any nested blocks.

**Why use them?**

- We use blocks when a single statement is required by the syntax (like loop bodies) but our code needs multiple statements.
- By grouping statements in curly braces, we turn them into a single "compound statement" that fulfills the single-statement requirement.

**Example:**

```cpp
while (val <= 10) {
  sum += val;  // Add val to sum
  ++val;       // Increment val
}
```

In this example, the `while` loop requires a single statement, but we need two statements (adding to `sum` and incrementing `val`). By enclosing them in braces, we create a block that acts as the loop's body.

**Empty Blocks:**

- We can create an empty block with just curly braces `{}`. This is equivalent to a null statement (doing nothing).

**Example:**

```cpp
while (cin >> s && s != sought) {
  // Empty block (no statements)
}
```

This `while` loop continues as long as input is successful (`cin >> s`) and the value isn't equal to `sought`. The empty block ensures the loop has a body, even though we don't have any specific actions to perform within this loop iteration.
