**Key Points:**

1. **Purpose**:
   - Jump statements interrupt the normal flow of execution in a program.

2. **Types of Jump Statements**:
   - **break**:
     - Exits from the innermost loop or switch statement.
   - **continue**:
     - Skips the remaining code in the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the innermost loop.
   - **goto**:
     - Transfers control to a labeled statement within the same function.
   - **return**:
     - Exits from a function and optionally returns a value. (Covered later)

**Usage:**

1. **break**:
   - Typically used to exit loops or switch cases.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
         if (i == 5) {
             break; // exits the loop when i is 5
         }
     }
     ```

2. **continue**:
   - Used to skip the rest of the loop body and continue with the next iteration.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
         if (i % 2 == 0) {
             continue; // skips the rest of the loop body for even numbers
         }
         // process odd numbers
     }
     ```

3. **goto**:
   - Used to jump to a labeled statement.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int x = 10;
     if (x > 0) {
         goto label; // jumps to the labeled statement
     }
     // some code here
     label:
     // code to execute after the jump
     ```

4. **return**:
   - Exits the current function and optionally returns a value.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int sum(int a, int b) {
         return a + b; // exits the function and returns the sum
     }
     ```

**Summary:**

- **Jump Statements**:
  - **break**: Exits loops or switch statements.
  - **continue**: Skips to the next iteration of a loop.
  - **goto**: Jumps to a labeled statement.
  - **return**: Exits a function and optionally returns a value.

Jump statements are powerful tools for controlling program flow, but should be used judiciously to maintain code readability and structure.

## <font color="yellow"><u>The break Statement:</u></f>

**Key Points:**

1. **Function of `break`**:
   - Terminates the nearest enclosing `while`, `do while`, `for`, or `switch` statement.
   - Execution resumes at the statement immediately following the terminated statement.

2. **Usage Restrictions**:
   - Can appear only within an iteration statement or `switch` statement.
   - Affects only the nearest enclosing loop or switch.

**Example:**

```cpp
string buf;
while (cin >> buf && !buf.empty()) {
    switch(buf[0]) {
        case '-':
            // Process up to the first blank
            for (auto it = buf.begin()+1; it != buf.end(); ++it) {
                if (*it == ' ')
                    break; // #1, leaves the for loop
                // ...
            }
            // break #1 transfers control here
            // Remaining '-' processing:
            break; // #2, leaves the switch statement

        case '+':
            // ...
    } // end switch
    // End of switch: break #2 transfers control here
} // end while
```

**Explanation:**

- **Break #1**:
  - Terminates the `for` loop following the hyphen (`-`) case label.
  - Does not terminate the enclosing `switch` statement.
  - Control resumes with the first statement following the `for` loop.

- **Break #2**:
  - Terminates the `switch` statement.
  - Does not terminate the enclosing `while` loop.
  - Control resumes with the execution of the condition in the `while` loop.

**Summary:**

- **Scope**: `break` affects only the nearest enclosing loop or switch.
- **Placement**: Can only be used inside loops or switch statements.
- **Control Flow**:
  - Terminates the specific loop or switch.
  - Execution continues at the next statement outside the terminated structure.

Understanding the behavior and scope of the `break` statement is crucial for managing control flow in loops and switch statements effectively.

## <font color="yellow"><u>The continue Statement:</u></f>

**Key Points:**

1. **Functionality**:
   - A `continue` statement terminates the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and immediately begins the next iteration.
   - Applicable only within `for`, `while`, or `do while` loops, including nested blocks within these loops.

2. **Scope of Effect**:
   - Similar to `break`, a `continue` inside a nested loop affects only the nearest enclosing loop.
   - Unlike `break`, a `continue` can appear inside a `switch` only if the `switch` is embedded in a loop.

3. **Execution Flow**:
   - **`while` or `do while` loops**:
     - Execution continues by evaluating the loop condition.
   - **Traditional `for` loops**:
     - Execution continues at the expression inside the `for` header.
   - **Range-based `for` loops**:
     - Execution continues by initializing the control variable from the next element in the sequence.

**Example:**

- **Processing Input with `continue`**:
  - The loop reads standard input one word at a time.
  - Only words that begin with an underscore are processed; others cause the loop to continue to the next iteration.

  ```cpp
  string buf;
  while (cin >> buf && !buf.empty()) {
      if (buf[0] != '_')
          continue; // get another input
      // still here? the input starts with an underscore; process buf . . .
  }
  ```

**Summary:**

- **Purpose**: To skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and proceed with the next one.
- **Usage**: Effective in loops to conditionally bypass certain operations and move to the next iteration.
- **Loop Types**: Can be used in `for`, `while`, and `do while` loops, and within a `switch` statement only if embedded in a loop.
- **Flow**: Alters the usual loop flow by re-evaluating the loop condition or continuing at the loop expression or next sequence element, depending on the loop type.

## <font color="yellow"><u>The goto Statement:</u></f>

**Key Points:**

1. **Purpose of `goto`**:
   - Provides an unconditional jump to another statement within the same function.

2. **Avoid Using `goto`**:
   - `goto` statements make programs difficult to understand and modify.

3. **Syntax**:
   - The syntax for a `goto` statement is:
     ```cpp
     goto label;
     ```
   - `label` is an identifier that marks a target statement.

4. **Labeled Statement**:
   - A labeled statement is preceded by an identifier followed by a colon:
     ```cpp
     end: return; // labeled statement; may be the target of a goto
     ```

5. **Label Identifiers**:
   - Labels are independent of other identifiers in the program.
   - A label can share the same identifier as a variable or other entities without interference.

6. **Scope Rules**:
   - The `goto` and its target label must be in the same function.
   - A `goto` cannot transfer control from a point where an initialized variable is out of scope to a point where the variable is in scope:
     ```cpp
     // . . .
     goto end;
     int ix = 10; // error: goto bypasses an initialized variable definition
     end:
     // error: code here could use ix but the goto bypassed its declaration
     ix = 42;
     ```

7. **Backward Jump**:
   - Jumping backward over an already executed definition is allowed.
   - Jumping back to a point before a variable is defined destroys and reconstructs the variable:
     ```cpp
     // backward jump over an initialized variable definition is okay
     begin:
     int sz = get_size();
     if (sz <= 0) {
         goto begin;
     }
     ```
   - In this example, `sz` is destroyed when the `goto` executes and is redefined and reinitialized when control passes back to `begin`.

**Summary:**

- **Avoid `goto`**: Prefer structured control flow constructs to maintain readability and maintainability.
- **Syntax**: `goto label;` with labeled statements as targets.
- **Scope Considerations**: Ensure `goto` does not bypass variable initialization.
- **Backward Jump**: Allowed but results in variable destruction and reinitialization.

Understanding these rules helps in avoiding potential pitfalls associated with the `goto` statement, promoting better programming practices.
