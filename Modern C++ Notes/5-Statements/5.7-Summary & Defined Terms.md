#### Statements Affecting Flow Control:

- **while, for, and do while statements**:
  - Provide iterative execution based on a condition.

- **if and switch statements**:
  - Enable conditional execution based on different conditions or values.

- **continue statement**:
  - Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration.

- **break statement**:
  - Exits a loop or switch statement prematurely.

- **goto statement**:
  - Transfers control to a labeled statement elsewhere in the code, but its use is discouraged due to complicating program flow.

- **try and catch**:
  - Defines a `try` block for potentially throwing exceptions, caught by corresponding `catch` clauses that handle specific types of exceptions.

- **throw expression**:
  - Raises an exception, interrupting the current execution path and transferring control to an appropriate `catch` clause.

- **return statement**:
  - Ends the execution of a function and optionally returns a value.

#### Additional Statements:

- **Expression statement**:
  - An expression followed by a semicolon, which evaluates the expression.

- **Declaration statement**:
  - Defines variables or functions.

#### Defined Terms

- **block**:
  - Sequence of statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

- **break statement**:
  - Terminates the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement.

- **case label**:
  - Constant expression in a `switch` statement that matches a specific value.

- **catch clause**:
  - Handles exceptions of a specified type thrown within a `try` block.

- **compound statement**:
  - Synonym for block.

- **continue statement**:
  - Skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceeds with the next iteration.

- **dangling else**:
  - Issue in nested `if` statements where an `else` might match an unexpected `if` due to indentation.

- **default label**:
  - `case` label that handles any unmatched value in a `switch` statement.

- **do while statement**:
  - Similar to `while`, but checks the condition at the end of the loop, ensuring the body executes at least once.

- **exception classes**:
  - Standard library classes used to represent errors and exceptions.

- **exception declaration**:
  - Type declared in a `catch` clause that specifies the exception type it can handle.

- **exception handler**:
  - Code in a `catch` clause that manages exceptions.

- **exception safe**:
  - Programs that handle exceptions gracefully and correctly.

- **expression statement**:
  - Evaluates an expression followed by a semicolon.

- **flow of control**:
  - Path of execution through a program.

- **for statement**:
  - Iteration statement used to iterate through a sequence or repeat a calculation.

- **goto statement**:
  - Transfers control unconditionally to a labeled statement, but usage is discouraged.

- **if else statement**:
  - Executes code based on the result of a condition.

- **if statement**:
  - Executes code if a specified condition is true.

- **labeled statement**:
  - Statement preceded by a label and colon.

- **null statement**:
  - Empty statement represented by a single semicolon.

- **raise**:
  - Synonym for `throw`, referring to throwing an exception.

- **range for statement**:
  - Iterates through elements of a sequence.

- **switch statement**:
  - Conditional statement that evaluates an expression and transfers control to matching case labels or default.

- **terminate**:
  - Library function called if an exception is not caught, leading to program termination.

- **throw expression**:
  - Interrupts execution by throwing an object and transferring control to a `catch` clause.

- **try block**:
  - Encloses code that might throw exceptions, followed by `catch` clauses to handle specific exceptions.

- **while statement**:
  - Executes a statement as long as a specified condition is true.

#### Summary:

C++ statements control program flow through iteration, conditionals, and exception handling. Understanding these constructs is essential for effective program design and execution.
