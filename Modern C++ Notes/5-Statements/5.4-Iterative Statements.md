## Iterative Statements (Loops)

- **Purpose:** Execute code repeatedly until a condition is true.
- **Types:**
    - `while` & `for`: Check condition **before** executing the loop body.
    - `do-while`: Executes the body **at least once**, then checks the condition.

**Key Point:** Loops improve efficiency by avoiding repetitive code writing.

## <font color="yellow"><u>The while Statement:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Summary:**

- Used to repeat a block of code (`statement`) as long as a certain condition is true.
- Syntax:

```cpp
while (condition):
  statement
```

**Explanation:**

- `condition`: This can be an expression or a variable. The loop continues to execute as long as this condition evaluates to `True`.
- `statement`: This is the code that will be repeated. It's often a block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- **Important:** The condition or the code inside the loop (`statement`) must change the value of the condition somehow. Otherwise, the loop might run forever.

**Variable Scope:**

- <font color="red">Variables defined inside the `while` loop or its condition are created and destroyed at the beginning and end of each iteration, respectively</font>.

## <font color="green0">Using a while Loop</f>

**When to Use While Loops:**

- **Indefinite Iteration:** Use while loops when you don't know beforehand how many times you need to repeat a block of code. This is common for reading input from the user until they stop.
- **Accessing Loop Control Variable:** While loops are useful when you need the value of the loop counter variable after the loop finishes.

**Examples:**

1. **Reading Input:**
    
    - Loop continues as long as valid data can be read from standard input (`cin`).
    - Loop terminates on invalid input or end-of-file.
    
    ```cpp
    vector<int> v;
    int i;
    while (cin >> i) {
        v.push_back(i);
    }
    ```
    
2. **Finding a Specific Element:**
    
    - Loop iterates through a vector until it finds an element with a specific condition (e.g., first negative element).
    - The loop control variable (`beg`) points to either the end of the vector (`v.end()`) or the element matching the condition.
    
    ```cpp
    auto beg = v.begin();
    while (beg != v.end() && *beg >= 0) {
        ++beg;
    }
    
    if (beg == v.end()) {
        // all elements in v are greater than or equal to zero
    }
    ```

## <font color="yellow">Traditional for Statement</f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Structure:**

```cpp
for (init-statement; condition; expression)
  statement
```

**Explanation:**

- **for header:** `for` keyword followed by everything inside the parentheses.
- **init-statement:** Initializes a loop counter or variable (can be skipped).
- **condition:** Loop continues as long as this evaluates to `true`.
- **expression:** Updates the loop counter or variable after each iteration.
- **statement:** Code to be executed repeatedly (can be a single line or a block).

**Breakdown:**

- The loop starts with an optional initialization statement.
- Then, the condition is checked. If it's `true`, the code block within the `statement` is executed.
- After the code runs, the expression updates the loop variable.
- The condition is checked again, and the loop repeats as long as it's `true`.

**In simpler terms:**

- Set up a variable (optional).
- Check a condition to keep looping.
- Do something with your data.
- Update the variable for the next loop.
- Repeat until the condition is false.

## <font color="green0">Execution Flow in a Traditional for Loop</f>

**Given the following for loop:**

```cpp
// process characters in s until we run out of characters or we hit a whitespace
for( decltype(s.size()) index = 0;
index != s.size() && !isspace(s[index]); ++index )
{
	s[index] = toupper(s[index]); // capitalize the current character
}

```

**Steps:**

1. **Initialization (once):**
    
    - A variable (e.g., `index`) is declared and initialized with a starting value (e.g., `0`).
2. **Condition Check (every iteration):**
    
    - The condition is evaluated. The loop continues as long as the condition is true.
    - In this example, the loop continues if:
        - `index` is less than the size of the string (`s.size()`)
        - AND the character at the current index (`s[index]`) is not a whitespace.
3. **Body Execution (if condition is true):**
    
    - The code within the loop (`{}`) is executed.
    - In this example, the character at the current index (`s[index]`) is converted to uppercase.
4. **Update (every iteration):**
    
    - An expression is evaluated to update the loop variable (e.g., incrementing `index` by 1).
5. **Repeat:**
    
    - Go back to step 2 and continue iterating until the condition becomes false.

**Notes:**

- The initialization happens only once at the beginning.
- Steps 2, 3, and 4 repeat until the condition is no longer true.
- Variables declared within the for loop header (e.g., `index`) are only accessible within the loop body.

## <font color="green0">Multiple Definitions in the for Header</f>

**Key Points:**

1. **Multiple Objects in `init-statement`**:
   - In a `for` loop, the `init-statement` can define multiple objects.
   - All variables defined in the `init-statement` must share the same base type.

2. **Single Declaration Statement**:
   - The `init-statement` is limited to a single declaration statement.

**Example:**

- The following loop duplicates the elements of a vector by appending them to the end:
    
    ```cpp
    // Remember the size of v and stop when we get to the original last element
    for (decltype(v.size()) i = 0, sz = v.size(); i != sz; ++i)
        v.push_back(v[i]);
    ```
    
   - **Explanation**:
     - **Index (`i`) and Loop Control (`sz`)**:
       - `i` is the index variable.
       - `sz` holds the size of the vector `v` at the start of the loop.
     - **Loop Condition**:
       - The loop continues until `i` reaches `sz`.
     - **Operation**:
       - Inside the loop, elements of `v` are duplicated and appended to `v`.

**Summary:**

- In a `for` loop, you can define multiple variables in the `init-statement` as long as they have the same base type.
- This allows for concise and efficient loop control by initializing multiple variables in one declaration.

## <font color="green0">Omitting Parts of the for Header</f>

**Key Points:**

1. **Parts of the `for` Header**:
   - A `for` loop header can omit any (or all) of the `init-statement`, `condition`, or `expression`.

2. **Null `init-statement`**:
   - Use a null statement when initialization is unnecessary.
   - Example:
     
     ```cpp
     auto beg = v.begin();
     for ( /* null */; beg != v.end() && *beg >= 0; ++beg)
         ; // no work to do
     ```
     
   - **Explanation**:
     - The semicolon represents a null `init-statement`.
     - The loop body is empty because all the work is done in the condition and expression.

3. **Omitting `condition`**:
   - Equivalent to writing `true` as the condition.
   - Requires a statement in the loop body to exit the loop to avoid an infinite loop.
   - Example:
    
     ```cpp
     for (int i = 0; /* no condition */ ; ++i) {
         // process i; code inside the loop must stop the iteration!
     }
     ```

4. **Omitting `expression`**:
   - Either the condition or the body must advance the iteration.
   - Example:
     
     ```cpp
     vector<int> v;
     for (int i; cin >> i; /* no expression */ )
         v.push_back(i);
     ```
     
   - **Explanation**:
     - The condition (`cin >> i`) changes the value of `i`.
     - The loop ends when input is exhausted or an error occurs.

**Summary:**

- **Null `init-statement`**: Use a semicolon to represent it.
- **No `condition`**: Implies a condition that always evaluates to `true`. Ensure the loop body can exit the loop.
- **No `expression`**: Ensure either the condition or the loop body advances the iteration.

These flexibilities allow for concise loop headers tailored to specific scenarios, enhancing code readability and functionality.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Range for Statement:</u></f>

**Key Points:**

1. **Simplified Iteration**:
   - The range for statement simplifies iteration through elements of a container or sequence.
   - Syntax: 
    
     ```cpp
     for (declaration : expression)
         statement
     ```
     
   - **expression** must represent a sequence (e.g., initializer list, array, `vector`, `string`).

2. **Declaration and Expression**:
   - **declaration** defines a variable that can hold each element of the sequence.
   - Ensure type compatibility by using `auto` to let the compiler deduce the correct type.
   - Use a reference type if the loop variable needs to modify the sequence elements.

3. **Iteration Process**:
   - On each iteration, the loop control variable is initialized with the next value from the sequence.
   - The loop continues until all elements have been processed.

4. **Example**:
   - Doubling the value of each element in a `vector`:
     
     ```cpp
     vector<int> v = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
     for (auto &r : v) // for each element in v
         r *= 2; // double the value of each element in v
     ```
     
   - **Explanation**:
     - `r` is the loop control variable, deduced by `auto`.
     - Declaring `r` as a reference allows modification of `v`'s elements.

5. **Equivalent Traditional `for` Loop**:
   - The range for is equivalent to the following traditional `for` loop:
     
     ```cpp
     for (auto beg = v.begin(), end = v.end(); beg != end; ++beg) {
         auto &r = *beg; // r must be a reference to change the element
         r *= 2; // double the value of each element in v
     }
     ```

6. **Limitations**:
   - **Adding Elements**: Cannot use a range for to add elements to a container.
     - <font color="red">The value of `end()` is cached</font>.
     - Adding/removing elements can invalidate the cached `end()`.

**Summary:**

- The range for statement provides a simpler and more readable way to iterate over sequences.
- It automatically handles the initialization and increment of iterators.
- Use `auto` to ensure type compatibility and references to modify sequence elements.
- Understand its limitations, particularly regarding modifying the container during iteration.

## <font color="yellow"><u>The do while Statement:</u></f>

**Key Points:**

1. **Basic Structure**:
   - A `do while` statement is similar to a `while` loop, but the condition is evaluated after the statement body completes.
   - The loop executes at least once regardless of the condition's value.

2. **Syntax**:

   ```cpp
   do
       statement
   while (condition);
   ```
   
   - Note: The `do while` statement ends with a semicolon after the parenthesized condition.

3. **Execution Flow**:
   - The `statement` inside the loop is executed first.
   - The `condition` is then evaluated.
   - If the `condition` is `false`, the loop terminates; if `true`, the loop repeats.
   - The `condition` cannot be empty.

4. **Variable Scope**:
   - Variables used in the `condition` must be defined outside the body of the `do while` statement.

**Example Program:**

- Program to repeatedly sum pairs of numbers:
    
    ```cpp
    // repeatedly ask the user for a pair of numbers to sum
    string rsp; // used in the condition; can't be defined inside the do
    do {
        cout << "please enter two values: ";
        int val1 = 0, val2 = 0;
        cin >> val1 >> val2;
        cout << "The sum of " << val1 << " and " << val2
             << " = " << val1 + val2 << "\n\n"
             << "More? Enter yes or no: ";
        cin >> rsp;
    } while (!rsp.empty() && rsp[0] != 'n');
    ```
    
   - **Explanation**:
     - The loop prompts the user for two numbers and prints their sum.
     - It then asks the user if they want to perform another sum.
     - The loop continues as long as the response is not empty and does not start with 'n'.

5. **Variable Declaration in Condition**:
   - Variables cannot be declared in the condition of a `do while` loop because the condition is evaluated after the statement body executes, leading to a potential use of an uninitialized variable.
   - Example of incorrect usage:
    
     ```cpp
     do {
         // ...
         mumble(foo);
     } while (int foo = get_foo()); // error: declaration in a do condition
     ```

**Summary:**

- The `do while` loop guarantees at least one execution of the loop body.
- Ensure the `condition` is non-empty and that any variables used in the `condition` are defined outside the loop.
- Avoid declaring variables within the `condition` to prevent undefined behavior.
