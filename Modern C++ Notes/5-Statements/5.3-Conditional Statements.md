**Controlling Program Flow**

C++ offers two primary ways to make decisions and control the flow of your program's execution:

1. **if statements:** These statements evaluate a condition. If the condition is true, a block of code following the `if` statement is executed.
    
2. **switch statements:** These statements evaluate an integer expression and compare it to multiple cases. Based on the matching case, a specific block of code is executed.
    

By mastering these conditional statements, you can write programs that react differently based on various situations, making your code more dynamic and adaptable.

## <font color="yellow"><u>The if Statement:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Concept:**

The `if` statement allows you to conditionally execute code based on whether a specific condition is true.

**Forms:**

There are two main forms of the `if` statement:

1. **Simple if:**
    
    - Executes a single statement if the condition is true.
2. **if-else:**
    
    - Executes one statement if the condition is true, and a different statement if the condition is false.

**Syntax:**

1. **Simple if:**

```cpp
if (condition)
    statement;
```

2. **if-else:**

```cpp
if (condition)
    statement1;
else
    statement2;
```

**Breakdown:**

- `condition`: This is an expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`. It can be a simple comparison, a function call that returns a boolean value, or any other expression that results in a boolean type.
- `statement`: This is the code that will be executed if the condition is true (for both forms). It can be a single statement or a block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- `statement2`: This is the code that will be executed if the condition is false (only in the `if-else` form). Similar to `statement`, it can be a single line or a code block.

**Key Points:**

- The parentheses around `condition` are mandatory.
- `condition` can involve variables, expressions, or function calls, but it must ultimately evaluate to a boolean type (`bool`). You can use type conversions if necessary (see "Type Conversions" for details).
- Both `statement` and `statement2` can be single lines of code or code blocks enclosed in curly braces.

**Execution Flow:**

- The `condition` is evaluated.
- If `condition` is true:
    - The code in `statement` is executed.
    - Execution continues with the code following the `if` statement.
- If `condition` is false:
    - In a simple `if`, execution continues with the code following the `if` statement.
    - In an `if-else`, the code in `statement2` is executed.

## <font color="green0">Using an if else Statement</f>

**Problem:** Calculate a letter grade from a numeric grade (0-100).

- A grade of 100 gets an "A++"
- Grades below 60 get an "F"
- Others range in increments of 10:
    - 60-69: "D"
    - 70-79: "C"
    - etc.

**Solution:** We'll use an `if-else` statement to handle failing and passing grades.

**Steps:**

1. **Define Letter Grades:**
    
    - Create a constant vector `scores` to store letter grades (F, D, C, B, A, A++).
    
2. **Calculate Letter Grade:**
    
    - Declare a string variable `lettergrade` to store the result.
    - Use an `if-else` statement:
        - **if (grade < 60):**
            - If the grade is less than 60, it's an "F". Assign "F" to `lettergrade` directly from the `scores` vector using index 0.
        - **else:**
            - Otherwise, calculate the appropriate index for the remaining grades (passing grades).
                - Subtract 50 from the grade to account for the larger range of failing grades.
                - Perform integer division by 10 (truncates remainder) to get the index within the `scores` vector.
                - Assign the letter grade from the calculated index in `scores` to `lettergrade`.

**Explanation:**

- The `if-else` statement checks if the grade is failing (< 60).
- If failing, the code assigns "F" directly.
- If passing, the code calculates the index within the `scores` vector based on the grade's range (60-69, 70-79, etc.).
- Integer division ensures we get the correct grade category (D, C, B, etc.).

**Remember:** This example uses integer division, which truncates the remainder. For more precise calculations, consider using floating-point division.

## <font color="green0">Nested if Statements</f>

**Adding +/- to Grades:**

This section explores how to modify grades to include a plus or minus based on the last digit. We achieve this using nested if statements.

**Logic Breakdown:**

1. **Modulus Operator (Remainder):**
    
    - We leverage the `%` (modulus) operator (covered in § 4.2, p. 141 - not provided here) to obtain the remainder after dividing the grade by 10.
    - This remainder indicates the unit digit of the grade.
    
2. **Nested if-else for +/- Assignment:**
    
    - **Outer if:** Checks if the remainder is greater than 7 (`grade % 10 > 7`).
        - **True:** Appends a `'+'` to the `lettergrade` variable (grades ending in 8 or 9 get a plus).
    - **Outer else if:** Checks if the remainder is less than 3 (`grade % 10 < 3`).
        - **True:** Appends a `'-'` to the `lettergrade` variable (grades ending in 0, 1, or 2 get a minus).

**Integration with Letter Grade Assignment:**

The nested if statements are incorporated within the logic for assigning letter grades:

1. **Failing Grades:**
    
    - If the grade is below 60 (`grade < 60`), the letter grade is directly assigned from the `scores` array (no +/- adjustment).
    
2. **Passing Grades (with +/- logic):**
    
    - An `else` block handles grades 60 or higher.
        - The letter grade is fetched from the `scores` array based on the logic `(grade - 50)/10`.
        - An inner `if` statement checks if the grade is not already 100 (no +/- for A++).
            - If not 100, the nested if-else statements from step 2 above are used to conditionally add +/- based on the unit digit.

**Note:**

- The outer `else` block ensures the +/- logic is only applied to passing grades (above 60 and not already A++).
- Indentation is crucial for proper interpretation of nested if statements.

## <font color="green0">Watch Your Braces</f>

**Common Mistake:** Forgetting curly braces when multiple statements need to be executed as a block within conditional statements (if, else if, else).

**Example:**

```cpp
if (grade < 60)
  lettergrade = scores[0];  // This is correct
else  // WRONG: missing curly braces!
  lettergrade = scores[(grade - 50)/10];
  // This will always execute, assigning incorrectly for failing grades
  
// despite appearances, without the curly brace, this code is always executed
// failing grades will incorrectly get a - or a +
   if (grade != 100)
     if (grade % 10 > 7)
       lettergrade += ’+’; // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a +
       else if (grade % 10 < 3)
              lettergrade += ’-’; // grades ending in 0, 1, or 2 get a -

```

**Why it's tricky:** Indentation can be misleading. Without curly braces, all subsequent indented statements will be executed regardless of the original condition.

**Solution:** Always use curly braces! This ensures:

- Clarity: Code is easier to read and understand.
- Maintainability: Future modifications won't accidentally break logic.

**Benefits of consistent bracing:**

- Avoids confusion about code execution flow.
- Makes adding statements in the future easier (braces are already there).

**Remember:** Consistent bracing is a good coding practice for improved readability and maintainability.

## <font color="green0">Dangling else</f>

**Problem:**

In nested `if` statements, with more `if`s than `else`s, it's unclear which `if` an `else` belongs to. This is known as the dangling else problem.

**C++ Solution:**

C++ resolves this by attaching the `else` to the **closest preceding unmatched `if`**.

**Example (Incorrect Indentation):**

```cpp
// This is wrong! Else goes with inner if, not intended outer if.
if (grade % 10 >= 3)
  if (grade % 10 > 7)
    lettergrade += ’+’;  // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a +
  else
    lettergrade += ’-’;  // grades 3-7 get a minus (WRONG!)
```

**Explanation:**

Here, the indentation suggests the `else` applies to the outer `if`. However, due to the dangling else rule, it actually applies to the inner `if`. This results in grades ending in 3-7 getting a minus, which is not the intended behavior.

**Correct Indentation:**

```cpp
// This indentation reflects the actual execution, not intended behavior.
if (grade % 10 >= 3)
  if (grade % 10 > 7)
    lettergrade += ’+’;  // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a +
  else
    lettergrade += ’-’;  // grades 3-7 get a minus (WRONG!)
```

**Key Points:**

- Use proper indentation to improve code readability, but remember C++ follows the dangling else rule.
- Be explicit with braces `{}` to group statements with specific `if` conditions.

## <font color="green0">Controlling the Execution Path with Braces</f>

**Problem:** Confusing `else` association in nested `if` statements.

**Solution:** Use curly braces `{}` to group statements and clarify `else` association.

**Example:**

```cpp
if (grade % 10 >= 3) {
  if (grade % 10 > 7) {
    lettergrade += '+'; // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a +
  }
} else { // curlies force the else to go with the outer if
  lettergrade += '-'; // grades ending in 0, 1, or 2 get a minus
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The inner `if` checks for grades ending in 8 or 9.
- Without braces, the `else` would apply only to the inner `if`.
- By adding braces around the inner `if` block, we clarify that the `else` applies to the entire outer `if` statement.
- Statements don't span block boundaries.
- The inner `if` ends before the `else`, making it part of the outer `if`.

**Benefit:** Braces ensure intended logic and prevent unexpected behavior.

## <font color="yellow"><u>The switch Statement:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**Purpose:**

The `switch` statement provides a clean way to handle multiple fixed alternatives based on a single expression's value.

**Example: Vowel Counting**

Imagine a program that counts the occurrences of each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) in a text. Here's the logic:

1. Read characters one by one.
2. Check if the character is a vowel.
3. If it's a vowel, increment the corresponding counter (aCnt, eCnt, etc.).
4. Display the final vowel counts.

**Solution with switch:**

```cpp
// Initialize vowel counters
unsigned aCnt = 0, eCnt = 0, iCnt = 0, oCnt = 0, uCnt = 0;
char ch;

while (cin >> ch) {
// if ch is a vowel, increment the appropriate counter
switch (ch) {
	case ’a’:
		++aCnt;
	break;
	case ’e’:
		++eCnt;
	break;
	case ’i’:
		++iCnt;
	break;
	case ’o’:
		++oCnt;
	break;
	case ’u’:
		++uCnt;
	break;
	}
}
// print results
cout << "Number of vowel a: \t" << aCnt << ’\n’
<< "Number of vowel e: \t" << eCnt << ’\n’
<< "Number of vowel i: \t" << iCnt << ’\n’
<< "Number of vowel o: \t" << oCnt << ’\n’
<< "Number of vowel u: \t" << uCnt << endl;
```

**How it works:**

1. The `switch` statement evaluates the expression in parentheses (usually a character variable).
2. The expression's value is converted to an integer type.
3. The converted value is compared with each `case` label's value.
4. If a match is found, the code following that `case` executes until a `break` statement.
    - `break` exits the `switch` completely.
5. If no match is found, and there's a `default` case, the code within `default` executes.
6. Otherwise, the program continues after the `switch` statement.

**Key Points:**

- `case` labels must be constant integer expressions (e.g., literals, variables with constant values).
- Duplicate `case` labels are error.
- `break` is crucial; without it, execution falls through to the next `case` even if it doesn't match.

## <font color="green0">Control Flow within a switch</f>

**Understanding Execution Flow:**

- By default, execution in a switch statement falls through subsequent cases after a match.
- To prevent this, use the `break` statement to explicitly stop execution.
- The `break` statement is usually placed before the next case label.

**The `default` Case:**

- The `default` case executes if no other case matches the expression value.
- It's useful when you have a specific action for unmatched values.

**Fall-Through Behavior:**

- Omitting `break` allows the program to fall through multiple cases with shared code.
- This is useful for actions common across multiple case values.

**Example: Counting Vowels**

```cpp
unsigned vowelCnt = 0;
// ...

switch (ch) {
  case 'a':
  case 'e':
  case 'i':
  case 'o':
  case 'u':
    ++vowelCnt;
    break;
}
```

- We stack cases without `break` to increment `vowelCnt` for all lowercase vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`).

**Case Label Syntax:**

- Case labels can appear on separate lines or all on a single line for a range of values.

**Example: Alternative Case Syntax**

```cpp
switch (ch) {
  case 'a': case 'e': case 'i': case 'o': case 'u':
    ++vowelCnt;
    break;
}
```

## <font color="green0">Forgetting a break Is a Common Source of Bugs</f>

**Problem:** Forgetting a `break` statement in a `switch` case is a common source of bugs.

**Misconception:** We might think only the code associated with the matched case executes.

**Incorrect Example:**

```cpp
// Warning: Deliberately incorrect!
switch (ch) {
  case 'a':
    ++aCnt; // oops: missing break
  case 'e':
    ++eCnt; // oops: missing break
  // ... similar cases for i, o, u
  case 'u':
    ++uCnt;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Assume `ch` is 'e'.
- Execution jumps to the code after `case 'e'`, incrementing `eCnt`.
- **Without a break, it falls through** to the next cases, also incrementing `iCnt`, `oCnt`, and `uCnt`. This is unintended behavior.

**Best Practice:**

- Include a `break` after **every** case (except potentially the last one) for safety.
- This prevents accidental fall-through if new cases are added later.

## <font color="green0">The default Label</f>

**What it is:**

The `default` label in a switch statement is used to specify code that executes when none of the other defined `case` labels match the value of the switch expression.

**Example:**

This example counts vowels and non-vowels using a switch statement:

```cpp
switch (ch) {
  case 'a': case 'e': case 'i': case 'o': case 'u':
    ++vowelCnt;
    break;
  default:
    ++otherCnt;
    break;
}
```

In this case, if `ch` is not a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), the code jumps to the `default` label and increments the `otherCnt` counter.

**Best Practices:**

- **Consider a default label even for no work:**  
    Adding an empty `default` section makes your code clearer, indicating you considered handling non-matching cases.
- **Default label placement:**  
    The `default` label must come before a statement or another `case` label.
- **Empty default handling:**  
    If a switch ends with a `default` with no work to do, follow it with a semicolon (`;`) or an empty block `{}`.

## <font color="green0">Variable Definitions inside the Body of a switch</f>

**Challenge:** In switch statements with jumpy execution, what happens if we define variables before a case label?

**The Problem:** Jumps can bypass code, potentially causing issues with uninitialized variables.

**Illegal Example:**

```cpp
case true:
  // Error: Bypassed initialization
  string file_name;  // Error: Implicit initialization bypassed
  int ival = 0;      // Error: Explicit initialization bypassed (illegal)
  int jval;          // Okay, not initialized yet

  break;

case false:
  // jval is usable but uninitialized
  jval = next_num();

  // file_name not initialized, could lead to unexpected behavior
  if (file_name.empty()) {
    // ...
  }
```

**Why is it illegal?** Jumping to `case false` skips initialization of `file_name` and `ival`. Using them later could lead to undefined behavior.

**The Solution:** Define variables within blocks for specific cases:

```cpp
case true:
{
  // Okay: block limits scope
  string file_name = get_file_name();
  // ...
}
  break;

case false:
  // Error: file_name not in scope here
  if (file_name.empty()) {
    // ...
  }
```

**Key Points:**

- Avoid variable definitions before case labels (potential for uninitialized variables).
- Use blocks within cases to ensure proper scope for case-specific variables.
