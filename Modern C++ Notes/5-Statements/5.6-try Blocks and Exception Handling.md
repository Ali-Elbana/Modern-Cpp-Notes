**Key Points:**

1. **Exceptions**:
   - Run-time anomalies that exist outside the normal functioning of a program (e.g., losing a database connection, encountering unexpected input).
   - Handling anomalous behavior is a challenging aspect of system design.

2. **Purpose of Exception Handling**:
   - Used when a part of a program detects a problem it cannot resolve.
   - The detecting part needs to signal the issue without knowing which part of the program will handle it.
   - The detecting part stops processing after signaling the problem.

3. **Structure of Exception Handling in C++**:
   - **Throw Expressions**:
     - Used by the detecting part to indicate an unhandled problem.
     - Raises an exception.
   - **Try Blocks**:
     - Used by the handling part to deal with exceptions.
     - Starts with the keyword `try` and ends with one or more `catch` clauses.
     - Exceptions thrown within a `try` block are usually handled by the corresponding `catch` clauses.
     - `catch` clauses are also known as exception handlers.
   - **Exception Classes**:
     - Used to pass information about what happened between a throw and an associated catch.

**Example of Exception Handling:**

```cpp
try 
{
    // Code that might raise an exception
    if (problemDetected) 
    {
        throw exceptionType; // Raising an exception
    }
} 
catch (exceptionType ex) 
{
    // Code to handle the exception
    // Possibly alert the user or correct the issue
}
```

**Summary:**

- **Throw Expressions**: Signal the occurrence of an exception.
- **Try Blocks**: Contain code that might raise exceptions and specify how to handle them using `catch` clauses.
- **Exception Classes**: Provide detailed information about the exception between throw and catch.

Exception handling supports the cooperation between the parts of a program that detect problems and those that handle them, ensuring robust and manageable error management.

## <font color="yellow"><u>A throw Expression:</u></f>

**Key Points:**

1. **Purpose**:
   - A `throw` expression raises an exception in a program.

2. **Syntax**:
   - Consists of the keyword `throw` followed by an expression.
   - The type of the expression determines the type of exception thrown.
   - Typically followed by a semicolon, making it an expression statement.

3. **Example Scenario**:
   - Consider a program that adds two `Sales_item` objects and checks if they refer to the same book.
   
     ```cpp
     Sales_item item1, item2;
     cin >> item1 >> item2;
     // first check that item1 and item2 represent the same book
     if (item1.isbn() == item2.isbn()) {
         cout << item1 + item2 << endl;
         return 0; // indicate success
     } else {
         cerr << "Data must refer to same ISBN" << endl;
         return -1; // indicate failure
     }
     ```

4. **Using `throw` for Error Handling**:
   - In a more complex program, the computation part might be separated from the user interaction part.
   - Instead of returning an error indicator, we can throw an exception.
   
     ```cpp
     // first check that the data are for the same item
     if (item1.isbn() != item2.isbn())
         throw runtime_error("Data must refer to same ISBN");
     // if weâ€™re still here, the ISBNs are the same
     cout << item1 + item2 << endl;
     ```

5. **Explanation**:
   - If `item1` and `item2` have different ISBNs, a `runtime_error` exception is thrown.
   - Throwing an exception terminates the current function and transfers control to an appropriate handler.

6. **`runtime_error` Type**:
   - Part of the standard library exception types, defined in the `stdexcept` header.
   - Requires initialization with a string or a C-style character string, providing additional information about the error.
   
**Summary:**

- **Usage of `throw`**: Raises exceptions to indicate errors or unusual conditions.
- **Syntax**: `throw` followed by an expression, usually with a semicolon.
- **Example**: Throwing `runtime_error` when ISBNs do not match.
- **Control Flow**: Transfers control to a handler, terminating the current function.

The `throw` expression is a powerful tool for managing exceptions, enhancing the robustness and clarity of error handling in programs.

## <font color="yellow"><u>The try Block:</u></f>

## <font color="green0">Introduction</f>

**General Form:**

- The `try` block is structured as follows:
  ```cpp
try 
{
	program-statements
}
catch (exception-declaration) 
{
    handler-statements
} 
catch (exception-declaration) 
{
    handler-statements
}
  // . . .
  ```

**Breakdown:**

1. **`try` Block**:
   - Begins with `try` followed by a block of program statements enclosed in curly braces.
   - Contains the normal logic of the program where exceptions might occur.

2. **`catch` Clauses**:
   - Immediately follow the `try` block.
   - Each `catch` clause starts with the keyword `catch`, followed by:
     - An exception declaration (optional), typically specifying the type of exception object to catch.
     - A block of statements (`handler-statements`) that executes if the corresponding exception is thrown.

3. **Execution Flow**:
   - When an exception is thrown within the `try` block:
     - The type of exception is matched with the `catch` clauses.
     - The first matching `catch` block's `handler-statements` are executed.
     - After executing the `catch` block, control continues with the statement immediately following the last `catch` clause of the `try` block.

4. **Scope and Accessibility**:
   - Variables declared inside the `try` block are local to that block.
   - They are not accessible outside of the `try` block, including in the `catch` clauses.

**Summary:**

- Use `try` blocks to encapsulate code where exceptions might occur.
- Define multiple `catch` clauses to handle different types of exceptions.
- Variables declared inside a `try` block are confined to that block and are not visible to `catch` clauses or outside the block.

Exception handling with `try` and `catch` provides structured error management in C++, allowing programs to gracefully handle unexpected conditions without terminating abruptly.

## <font color="green0">Writing a Handler</f>

**Key Points:**

1. **Handling Exceptions with `try` and `catch`**:
   - Use `try` blocks to enclose code that may throw exceptions.
   - `catch` blocks handle specific exception types.

2. **Example Scenario**:
   - Managing user interaction involving `Sales_items` that may throw a `runtime_error` if ISBNs don't match.

3. **Implementation**:
   ```cpp
   while (cin >> item1 >> item2) {
       try {
           // Code to add two Sales_items
           // Throws a runtime_error if ISBNs do not match
       } catch (runtime_error err) {
           // Handling the exception
           cout << err.what() << "\nTry Again? Enter y or n" << endl;
           char c;
           cin >> c;
           if (!cin || c == 'n')
               break; // Exit the while loop
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Explanation**:
   - **`try` Block**: Contains code that may throw `runtime_error`.
   - **`catch` Block**: Handles `runtime_error` exceptions.
     - Displays `err.what()` which returns a descriptive message (e.g., "Data must refer to same ISBN").
     - Prompts the user to retry (`y`) or exit (`n`).
     - If user enters `n`, breaks out of the loop; otherwise, continues to the next iteration.

5. **Exception Handling Details**:
   - The `what()` method of `runtime_error` returns a C-style character string explaining the exception.
   - Each exception class provides a `what()` method to retrieve its error message.

**Summary:**

- **`try` and `catch`**: Used to manage exceptions gracefully.
- **User Interaction**: Handled within the `try` block to maintain program flow and user experience.
- **Error Messaging**: Utilizes `err.what()` to communicate specific error details to the user.

This approach ensures robust error handling and user-friendly interactions when dealing with potential exceptions in program execution.

## <font color="green0">Functions Are Exited during the Search for a Handler</f>

#### Execution Path and Exception Handling:

1. **Complex Execution Paths**:
   - In complex systems, execution paths often traverse multiple `try` blocks.
   - Example: A function within a `try` block may call another function with its own `try`, forming a chain.

2. **Searching for a Handler**:
   - When an exception is thrown:
     - The search for a handler starts from the function that threw the exception.
     - If no matching `catch` block is found, the function terminates.
     - The search continues up the call stack until an appropriate `catch` block is found.

3. **Termination Behavior**:
   - If no appropriate handler is found throughout the call stack:
     - Execution is transferred to a system-dependent library function named `terminate`.
     - This function halts further execution of the program.

4. **Handling Exceptions Without `try` Blocks**:
   - Programs without `try` blocks handle exceptions similarly:
     - Without any `try` blocks, an exception triggers a call to `terminate`.
     - The program exits as there are no handlers defined.

#### Exception Safety and Program Flow:

- **Writing Exception Safe Code**:
  - Exceptions disrupt normal program flow, potentially leaving objects in invalid states or resources leaked.
  - Exception safe code ensures proper cleanup and maintains program integrity post-exception.
  - Achieving exception safety is challenging and requires careful consideration beyond basic error handling techniques.

- **Considerations for Exception Handling**:
  - Some programs use exceptions solely for program termination upon exceptional conditions.
  - Programs needing robust exception handling must anticipate potential exceptions and manage states to ensure object validity and resource management.
  - Techniques covered may aid in promoting exception safety but are not exhaustive in guaranteeing it.

#### Conclusion:

- Understanding how exceptions propagate through call chains and the necessity of handling them appropriately ensures program reliability and robustness.
- Exception safety is crucial in maintaining program integrity when exceptions occur, requiring a proactive approach to code design and error management.

### Standard Exception Classes in C++

#### Overview:

- C++ standard library defines several exception classes for reporting and handling errors encountered during program execution.

#### Headers:

1. **`<exception>`**:
   - Defines the most general exception class `exception`.
   - Provides basic information that an exception occurred without additional details.

2. **`<stdexcept>`**:
   - Defines general-purpose exception classes for common errors.
   - Includes:
     - `runtime_error`: Detected only at runtime.
     - `range_error`: Result outside meaningful range.
     - `overflow_error`: Computation overflowed.
     - `underflow_error`: Computation underflowed.
     - `logic_error`: Errors in program logic.
     - `domain_error`: Argument for which no result exists.
     - `invalid_argument`: Inappropriate argument.
     - `length_error`: Attempt to create object larger than maximum size.
     - `out_of_range`: Used a value outside valid range.

3. **`<new>`**:
   - Defines `bad_alloc` exception type.
   - Detailed later for memory allocation errors.

4. **`<typeinfo>`**:
   - Defines `bad_cast` exception type.
   - Covered later for type casting errors.

#### Usage:

- **Creating Objects**:
  - Objects of `exception`, `bad_alloc`, and `bad_cast` can only be default initialized.
  - Other exception types require initialization with a string or C-style string to provide error details.

- **Operations**:
  - All exception types support `what()`, which returns a `const char*` pointing to a C-style string.
  - The string provides textual description of the thrown exception:
    - For initialized types, `what()` returns the initializer string.
    - For uninitialized types, the content of `what()` varies by compiler.

#### Summary:

- Standard exception classes in C++ facilitate robust error handling.
- Use appropriate headers to access specific exception types based on error scenarios encountered during program execution.
